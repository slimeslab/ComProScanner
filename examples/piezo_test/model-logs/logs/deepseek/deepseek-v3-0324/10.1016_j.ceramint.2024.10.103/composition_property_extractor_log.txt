# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The microstructures of BFScx-BT ceramics sintered at the optimal sintering temperature are displayed in. As ScE^{3+} content increases from 0 to 0.01, the average grain size of the samples slightly increases from 6.55 \u03bcm to 7.53 \u03bcm, which may be caused by a slight elevation in optimal sintering temperature with the increasing ScE^{3+} content. With further increase in ScE^{3+} content, a notable decrease in grain size occurred, likely due to excessive ScE^{3+} precipitation at grain boundaries, restricting grain boundary migration and inhibiting grain growth via ScE^{3+} ion pinning. The relative density of the ceramics exceeds 98 %, indicating that ceramics were dense. (a) illustrates the XRD patterns of BFScx-BT ceramics, showing that all ceramic compositions exhibit a perovskite structure without impurity phases. Furthermore, the coexistence and variations of the rhombohedral RBF phase (R3c) and tetragonal TBT phase (P4mm) content are determined by enlarging the diffraction peaks of (111), and (200) in the BFScx-BT ceramics [see ]. With increasing ScE^{3+} content, a gradual shift of diffraction peak to the low angle side can be seen, which is probably due to the slight lattice expansion caused by the larger radius of ScE^{3+} compared with FeE^{3+} (when CN = 6, R Fe 3+ = 0.645 \xc5, R Sc 3+ = 0.745 \xc5). At the same time, compared with the undoped BF-BT ceramic, the (111) doublet splitting of BFScx-BT ceramics become more distinct as shown in (b), illustrating that rhombohedral distortion is more pronounced. To further visually explore the phase evolution with ScE^{3+} doping concentration, Rietveld refinement based on R3c and P4mm symmetries was conducted for the BFScx-BT ceramics (x = 0\u20130.02). Detailed analyses of the phase structure evolution are presented in (c\u2013d) and. The reliability factors for weighted patterns (Rwp), overall patterns (Rp), and the goodness of fit indicator (\u03c7E^{2}) were found to be in the ranges of 4.77%\u20136.72 %, 3.71%\u20135.32 %, and 2.72\u20133.49, respectively, indicating satisfactory and reliable fitting results. The ceramics for x = 0\u20130.02 are well described by a two-phase coexistence model of R3c and P4mm. The calculated volume fraction of the R phase demonstrates a monotonic increase from 63.1 % (x = 0) to 87.4 % (x = 0.02), while the cell volume also increases, which aligns well with the aforementioned analysis. depicts the Raman spectra of BFScx-BT (x = 0\u20130.02) ceramics measured at room temperature. By fitting the Raman spectra and decomposing them into Lorentzian components, we identified ten Raman-active modes in the BF-BT ceramic, as illustrated in (a). The Raman spectrum in the range of 160\u2013900 cmE^{\u22121} can be divided into three regions, namely, the low-frequency region (Region I \u2264 200 cmE^{\u22121}, Region II ~ 200-400 cmE^{\u22121}) and the high-frequency region (Region III \u2265400 cmE^{\u22121}) as shown in (a). Region I is associated with the vibrations of the A-site cation, while the B-O bond's vibration is extremely sensitive to the B-site cation's displacement, resulting in modes within the range of 200\u2013400 cmE^{\u22121}. Additionally, Region III primarily corresponds to the tilting or rotation of BO6 octahedra. In the low-frequency region, the increase in ScE^{3+} ions content triggers a redshift of the A1-3 mode as (b), indicating that the increase in ScE^{3+} ion content weakens the vibration of the B-O bond and diminishes the hybridization between the oxygen p-orbitals and the d-orbitals of FeE^{3+}/TiE^{4+}/ScE^{3+}. The change occurred in A1-3 mode has a close correlation with the formation of nanodomain, and an increase in strength of the nanodomain is reflected in the weakening of the B-O bond. In the wavenumber region of \u03bb \u2265 400 cmE^{\u22121}, What deserves attention is the change of A1-4 and E\u22127. The blueshifts of A1-4 and E\u22127 can reflect the successful substitution of FeE^{3+} by ScE^{3+}. It is due to larger ionic radius of ScE^{3+} than that of FeE^{3+}, and ScE^{3+} doping may cause expansion of the perovskite unit cell and induces the blueshifts of modes A1-4 and E\u22127 in (b). In addition, The intensity ratio of I(E\u22127)/I(A1-4) can reflect the degree of distortion of the BO6 octahedron. On the one hand, BiScO3 (t = 0.907) has a smaller tolerance factor t, compared to that of BiFeO3 (t = 0.951). It means that the degree of octahedra distortion of BiScO3 is bigger. Therefore, ScE^{3+} substitution for FeE^{3+} enhances BO6 octahedron distortion. On the other hand, the increased ScE^{3+} content will disrupt the long-range ferroelectric orders and lead to the degenerated BO6 octahedral distortion. Ultimately, as shown in (c), the maximum distortion of BO6 octahedron is obtained at x = 0.01. The results show that the change of the doping content of ScE^{3+} affects the B-O bond strength and the degree of BO6 octahedron distortion. (a\u2013g) illustrates dielectric properties of BFScx-BT (x = 0\u20130.02) ceramics from 30 \xb0C to 550 \xb0C at different frequencies. As the content of ScE^{3+} increases, the dielectric peak shows a slight broadening, suggesting a slight enhancement of relaxor-like behavior, which aligns with the results obtained from Raman analysis. To further quantify the relaxor-like behavior, the diffuseness coefficient \u03b3 was calculated based on the modified Curie-Weiss law:  For typical ferroelectrics, \u03b3 is approximately 1, while for relaxor ferroelectrics, \u03b3 approaches 2. The ln(1/\u03b5r-1/\u03b5m) versus ln(T-Tm) curves for all compositions are shown in the inset of (a\u2013g). The values of \u03b3 gradually increase from 1.54 to 1.63 as x varies from 0 to 0.02, as depicted in (h). This slightly increased \u03b3 indicates that the relaxor-like behavior is marginally enhanced with the introduction of ScE^{3+}. The slightly increased relaxor-like behavior is attributed to the larger ionic radius of ScE^{3+} compared to FeE^{3+} ions, resulting in the emergence of local polar disordering when ScE^{3+} substitutes for FeE^{3+}. At the same time, it can be observed that the dielectric loss of the BFScx-BT ceramics increases significantly, reaching the order of 10E^{2} when the temperature is up to 400 \xb0C. However, there is a significant reduction in the dielectric loss when ScE^{3+} is doped into of the ceramic systems, which will be discussed later. We also found that with the doping of ScE^{3+}, the dielectric maximum temperature lightly decreases from 530 \xb0C to 511 \xb0C in (h), indicating that the high ferroelectric-to-paraelectric phase transition temperature of the ceramics could be maintained. (a) demonstrates the polarization-electric field (P-E) hysteresis loops of BFScx-BT ceramics. To better understand the influence of ScE^{3+} doping on the ferroelectric properties of BFScx-BT ceramics, the maximum polarization (Pmax), remanent polarization (Pr), and coercive field (Ec) were obtained from (a) and summarized as functions of ScE^{3+} content in (b). However, a slight decrease in Ps and Pr is observed at x = 0.005, which may attribute to the sudden drop in relative density at this composition, as indicated in. The maximum values of 2Pr (40.8 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}) and 2Pmax (55.0 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}) are achieved in the BFSc0.01-BT ceramic. The greater BO6 octahedral distortion generated by ScE^{3+} doping contributes to the larger structural asymmetry. This greatly enhances the intrinsic response and inherently contributes to the macroscopic ferroelectric properties of BFScx-BT ceramics. Moreover, the variation in the coercive field (Ec) with the addition of ScE^{3+} may be attributed not only to the high degree of lattice distortion but also to changes in grain size. This grain size effect is particularly relevant in BiFeO3-BaTiO3 ceramics and contributes to the observed changes in Ec with ScE^{3+} doping. The variation of piezoelectric response, \u03b5r and \u03b5r\xd7 Pr for BFScx-BT ceramics as a function of composition is depicted in. The d33 displays a trend that increases firstly and then decreases with the addition of ScE^{3+}. At x = 0.01, The best piezoelectric properties (d33\u223c163 pC/N) are acquired, with a high temperature (Tc\u223c518 \xb0C) as in. In general, the d33 coefficient is determined by the equation : with \u03b50 denoting the permittivity of free space and Q33 representing the electrostriction coefficient. It can be seen that there is a slight decrease in the value of \u03b5r from x = 0 to x = 0.02. However, it is noteworthy that the \u03b5r\xd7 Pr initially increases and then decreases, and exhibits the highest value when x = 0.01, which is consistent with the d33 values. Therefore, the observed enhancement in the d33 value can be primarily attributed to the increased polarization resulting from the greater asymmetry in the crystal structure. Magnetic property is also important for the ME effect of the BFScx-BT ceramics. (a) shows the M \u2212 H hysteresis loops of the compositions with different ScE^{3+} doping concentrations at room temperature. The saturation magnetization Ms, remnant magnetization Mr and coercive field Hc obtained from the M \u2212 H hysteresis loops are plotted in (b). With the increase of ScE^{3+} content, Ms reaches its maximum value of 0.14 emu/g at x = 0.01, while Mr remains essentially unchanged. The Jahn\u2013Teller effect reveals the fact that the BO6 octahedral distortion will break the local cycloidal spin structure and also result in the varying magnetization. The vary I(E\u22127)/I(A1-4) in (c) suggests the greatest distortion of the BO6 octahedra in BFSc0.01-BT ceramics, which generates the intense ferrimagnetism. The ScE^{3+} substitution simultaneously increases the piezoelectricity and ferromagnetism of BFScx-BT ceramics, potentially leading to a further improvement in the ME response. (c) illustrates the frequency dependence of the magnetoelectric coupling coefficient (\u03b1ME) of BFScx-BT (x = 0, 0.01, 0.02) ceramics, measured under a DC bias magnetic field of 6000 Oe. The figure reveals \u03b1ME peaks in the frequency range of 60\u2013100 kHz, which occurs because the amplitude of vibration is amplified near the mechanical resonance frequency, leading to an enhanced magnetoelectric response, as evidenced by the observation of the resonance and antiresonance peaks in the frequency ranges on the impedance spectra [shown in the inset of (c)]. For instance, with x = 0, \u03b1ME measured under a 6000 Oe DC magnetic field increases from approximately 50 mV/(cm\xb7Oe) below 70 kHz to around 465 mV/(cm\xb7Oe) at resonant frequencies. Finally, ScE^{3+} doping boosts the magnetoelectric response of the systems, increasing the peak \u03b1ME at the resonant frequency from \u223c465 mV/(cm\xb7Oe) at x = 0\u2013\u223c567 mV/(cm\xb7Oe) at x = 0.01. However, when ScE^{3+} doping is further increased to x = 0.02, a deterioration in both piezoelectric and magnetic properties lead to a subsequent decrease in the peak \u03b1ME, as shown in (c\u2013d). A summary of the magnetoelectric coupling coefficient for BiFeO3-based single-phase materials has been provided in. Based on the above analysis, the rare earth elements are proven to provides an effective approach for further enhancing the ME response of BF-BT-based ceramics. From , we can see that the dielectric loss of undoped BF-BT ceramics is suppressed by ScE^{3+} doping. The reduction of dielectric loss can be more clearly seen in (a), in which the temperature dependence of dielectric loss (tan \u03b4) (at 1 kHz) measured in BF-BT and BFSc0.01-BT ceramics is compared. As the temperature increased, the dielectric loss of the x = 0 sample exhibits a rapid rise, reaching approximately 2.5 at 200 \xb0C. In contrast, the x = 0.01 ceramics show a significantly lower loss, approximately 0.3 at 200 \xb0C. The resistivity of the compositions (x = 0, 0.01), as a function of temperature, is shown in. In the measured temperature range, the resistivity of BFSc0.01-BT consistently surpasses that of BF-BT, particularly at room temperature, where the resistance of BFSc0.01-BT is approximately an order of magnitude higher than that of the undoped BF-BT samples. Because the bandgap energy (Eg) of BiScO3 (>2.59eV) is larger than that of BiFeO3 (\u223c2.17eV), we speculate that the introduction of ScE^{3+} in BF-BT widens of the energy gap, leading to a decrease in conductivity. We measured the UV\u2013vis spectra of BF-BT and BFSc0.01-BT samples and the results are shown in. The Eg value can be calculated using the relationship: where \u03b1 is absorption coefficient, h is Planck's constant, and \u03bd is frequency. From the results, we can see that Eg of BFSc0.01-BT exceeds that of BF-BT by approximately 0.12 eV, which shows that ScE^{3+} substitution could effectively widen bandgap energy illustrated in (d). Moreover, in BF-based ceramics, it has been reported that the presence of defect dipoles generated by a change of FeE^{3+} to FeE^{2+}/FeE^{4+} transitions and a loss of Bi2O3 during sintering can cause a large leakage current and poor insulation performance. The XPS spectra for BF-BT and BFSc0.01-BT samples, as well as peak fitting for O1s and Fe2p elements, are shown in (a\u2013d). The peaks of Fe2p1/2 and Fe2p3/2 can be fitted into two sub-peaks, respectively. The fitted sub-peaks located at 709.4 eV and 722.9 eV can be assigned to FeE^{2+}, and 710.6 eV and 724.1 eV to FeE^{3+}, and 712.2 eV and 725.7 eV to FeE^{4+}. At the same time, O1s peak is fitted into three sub-peaks, corresponding to lattice oxygen OL at 529.3 eV, oxygen vacancies OV at 530.6 eV and oxygen due to surface adsorbates OAbs (or carbon-oxygen bond) at 531.6 eV. By introducing ScE^{3+}, there is a substantial rise in the FeE^{3+} content in BFSc0.01-BT ceramic compared with the undoped BF-BT sample [shown in (e\u2013f)]. It can be also observed that ScE^{3+} doping causes a marked reduction in the oxygen vacancy content. The doping of ScE^{3+} probably breaks the electron transfer path of adjacent FeE^{3+}, inhibiting the production of FeE^{2+} ions and the creation of oxygen vacancies.

# TITLE
Enhanced magnetoelectric response in Sc-doped BiFeO<inf>3</inf>-BaTiO<inf>3</inf> Ceramics

# ABSTRACT
In recent years, the single-phase BiFeO3-BaTiO3 multiferroic ceramics have gained attention for their magnetoelectric response above room temperature, but substantial endeavors to improve the property have yielded modest results. An optimized BiFe(1-x)ScxO3-BaTiO3 composition having magnetoelectric coefficient (αME) ∼ 567 mV/(cm·Oe)) measured at the resonant frequency (∼95 kHz) is reported in this work. The high αME is attributed to the combined effect of improved piezoelectric coefficient and enhanced ferromagnetism. Besides, the addition of Sc3+ can exhibit increased resistivity and reduced defect dipole effects, which is conducive to improving electric properties.

# INTRODUCTION
The couple between them manifests rich physical phenomena such as magnetoelectric (ME) effect, spin-orbit coupling effect and anomalous valley Hall effect. Notably, ME effect can realize the regulation of electric polarization by magnetic fields or magnetic moments by electric fields, and has garnered increasing interest due to its potential applications in spintronics, multi-state memory, and low-field magnetic sensors. To date, researchers have studied various single-phase ME materials, including BiFeO3, TbMnO3, BaMnF4, and Mn3B7O13X (M = Mn, Ni, Co; X = Cl, Br, I). However, most of these materials exhibit low ferroelectric or magnetic transition temperatures, lacking the ME effect at room temperature. Among a few single-phase multiferroics, BiFeO3 (BFO) possesses a rhombohedral distorted perovskite structure and has garnered increasing attention due to its coexistence of ferroelectricity (Curie temperature TC \u223c 1103K) and antiferromagnetism (N\xe9el temperature TN \u223c 643K) above room temperature, rendering it promising for multiferroic device applications. However, it also suffers from several inevitable drawbacks including high leakage current (Bi volatility and presence of impurity phases) and weak ferromagnetism , resulting in low ME effect. It was reported that introducing ABO3 perovskites (BaTiO3 , SrTiO3 , CaTiO3 , PbTiO3 , etc.) into a solid solution with BiFeO3 seems an effective way to suppress the formation of parasitical phases like Bi2Fe4O9 or Bi25FeO39, and improve the electric properties. In BiFeO3-BaTiO3 system, the substitution of BiFeO3 by BaTiO3 has been found to be a strategy to improve ME effect , however, acquiring the large ME effect still remains a pressing issue. Recently it was shown that the substitution of rare earth elements could effectively improve multiferroic performance of BF-BT ceramics. For example, A-site substitution using rare earth elements (La, Sm, or Nd) could suppress the dielectric loss and modify the polarization response in BF-BT system. B-site substitution of FeE^{3+} by rare earth elements (such as Sc, Te, Ga etc.) was found to improve the magnetization due to the enhanced ferromagnetic interaction between magnetic ions in BF as well as in BF-BT systems. Noteworthy studies by Kim et al. have demonstrated the effect of ScE^{3+} doping and revealed enhanced piezoelectric responses in 0.67BiFeO3\u20130.33BaTiO3-xBiScO3. This improvement is primarily attributed to the fact that the ScE^{3+} cation is electrically more stable than FeE^{3+}, which enhances the system's resistivity and ensures the fully realized polarization process, thereby promoting increased piezoelectric performance. Additionally, since the ScE^{3+} ion lacks unpaired d electrons, it cannot form antiferromagnetic coupling with FeE^{3+} ions, thereby releasing the latent magnetization trapped within the structure, leading to ferromagnetic behavior. Wu et al. demonstrated enhanced ferromagnetism in La and Sc co-doped BiFeO3 through the doping-induced structural distortion and the destruction of the antimagnetic ordering. Therefore, it is desired to evaluate the effects of rare Sc substitution on the ME response of BF-BT system. In this paper, we prepare the 0.725BiFe(1-x)ScxO3-0.275BaTiO3 ceramics (abbreviated as BFScx-BT, x = 0\u20130.02) via a solid-state reaction method, and investigate thoroughly the structural evolution, electrical properties, ferromagnetism and ME effect of the compositions. Eventually, the BFSc0.01-BT component realizes a relatively high d33 of 163 pC/N along with a high Curie temperature (518 \xb0C), while enhancing the ferromagnetism to a certain extent. Furthermore, an elevated magnetoelectric coupling coefficient (\u03b1ME\u223c567 mV/(cm\xb7Oe)) is achieved. Further analysis of high-temperature resistivity, ultraviolet\u2013visible photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) elucidates the physical mechanisms related to the reduction in leakage current.

# CONCLUSION
We systematically investigate the influence of ScE^{3+} doping on the microstructure, electric properties, ferromagnetic properties and ME effect of BFScx-BT ceramics. The XRD pattern shows that all the compositions exhibit perovskite structure with the coexistence of rhombohedral and tetragonal symmetries. Raman spectroscopy indicates that ScE^{3+} doping significantly increases the BO6 octahedral distortions of the compositions, which contribute to the enhancement of spontaneous polarization and the piezoelectric constant d33. The maximum 2Pr (40.7 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}) and the optimum d33 (163 pC/N) were achieved at x = 0.01, whereas the Curie temperature TC is 518 \xb0C, while the ferromagnetic properties are also enhanced to some extent. Conclusively, the peak \u03b1ME reaches its optimum value (\u223c567 mV/(cm\xb7Oe)) at the resonant frequency (\u223c95 kHz) in BFSc0.01-BT ceramics. Furthermore, the addition of ScE^{3+} could also increase the bandgap of this composition and suppress the generation of defects, significantly improving the resistivity.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The microstructures of BFScx-BT ceramics sintered at the optimal sintering temperature are displayed in. As ScE^{3+} content increases from 0 to 0.01, the average grain size of the samples slightly increases from 6.55 \u03bcm to 7.53 \u03bcm, which may be caused by a slight elevation in optimal sintering temperature with the increasing ScE^{3+} content. With further increase in ScE^{3+} content, a notable decrease in grain size occurred, likely due to excessive ScE^{3+} precipitation at grain boundaries, restricting grain boundary migration and inhibiting grain growth via ScE^{3+} ion pinning. The relative density of the ceramics exceeds 98 %, indicating that ceramics were dense. (a) illustrates the XRD patterns of BFScx-BT ceramics, showing that all ceramic compositions exhibit a perovskite structure without impurity phases. Furthermore, the coexistence and variations of the rhombohedral RBF phase (R3c) and tetragonal TBT phase (P4mm) content are determined by enlarging the diffraction peaks of (111), and (200) in the BFScx-BT ceramics [see ]. With increasing ScE^{3+} content, a gradual shift of diffraction peak to the low angle side can be seen, which is probably due to the slight lattice expansion caused by the larger radius of ScE^{3+} compared with FeE^{3+} (when CN = 6, R Fe 3+ = 0.645 \xc5, R Sc 3+ = 0.745 \xc5). At the same time, compared with the undoped BF-BT ceramic, the (111) doublet splitting of BFScx-BT ceramics become more distinct as shown in (b), illustrating that rhombohedral distortion is more pronounced. To further visually explore the phase evolution with ScE^{3+} doping concentration, Rietveld refinement based on R3c and P4mm symmetries was conducted for the BFScx-BT ceramics (x = 0\u20130.02). Detailed analyses of the phase structure evolution are presented in (c\u2013d) and. The reliability factors for weighted patterns (Rwp), overall patterns (Rp), and the goodness of fit indicator (\u03c7E^{2}) were found to be in the ranges of 4.77%\u20136.72 %, 3.71%\u20135.32 %, and 2.72\u20133.49, respectively, indicating satisfactory and reliable fitting results. The ceramics for x = 0\u20130.02 are well described by a two-phase coexistence model of R3c and P4mm. The calculated volume fraction of the R phase demonstrates a monotonic increase from 63.1 % (x = 0) to 87.4 % (x = 0.02), while the cell volume also increases, which aligns well with the aforementioned analysis. depicts the Raman spectra of BFScx-BT (x = 0\u20130.02) ceramics measured at room temperature. By fitting the Raman spectra and decomposing them into Lorentzian components, we identified ten Raman-active modes in the BF-BT ceramic, as illustrated in (a). The Raman spectrum in the range of 160\u2013900 cmE^{\u22121} can be divided into three regions, namely, the low-frequency region (Region I \u2264 200 cmE^{\u22121}, Region II ~ 200-400 cmE^{\u22121}) and the high-frequency region (Region III \u2265400 cmE^{\u22121}) as shown in (a). Region I is associated with the vibrations of the A-site cation, while the B-O bond's vibration is extremely sensitive to the B-site cation's displacement, resulting in modes within the range of 200\u2013400 cmE^{\u22121}. Additionally, Region III primarily corresponds to the tilting or rotation of BO6 octahedra. In the low-frequency region, the increase in ScE^{3+} ions content triggers a redshift of the A1-3 mode as (b), indicating that the increase in ScE^{3+} ion content weakens the vibration of the B-O bond and diminishes the hybridization between the oxygen p-orbitals and the d-orbitals of FeE^{3+}/TiE^{4+}/ScE^{3+}. The change occurred in A1-3 mode has a close correlation with the formation of nanodomain, and an increase in strength of the nanodomain is reflected in the weakening of the B-O bond. In the wavenumber region of \u03bb \u2265 400 cmE^{\u22121}, What deserves attention is the change of A1-4 and E\u22127. The blueshifts of A1-4 and E\u22127 can reflect the successful substitution of FeE^{3+} by ScE^{3+}. It is due to larger ionic radius of ScE^{3+} than that of FeE^{3+}, and ScE^{3+} doping may cause expansion of the perovskite unit cell and induces the blueshifts of modes A1-4 and E\u22127 in (b). In addition, The intensity ratio of I(E\u22127)/I(A1-4) can reflect the degree of distortion of the BO6 octahedron. On the one hand, BiScO3 (t = 0.907) has a smaller tolerance factor t, compared to that of BiFeO3 (t = 0.951). It means that the degree of octahedra distortion of BiScO3 is bigger. Therefore, ScE^{3+} substitution for FeE^{3+} enhances BO6 octahedron distortion. On the other hand, the increased ScE^{3+} content will disrupt the long-range ferroelectric orders and lead to the degenerated BO6 octahedral distortion. Ultimately, as shown in (c), the maximum distortion of BO6 octahedron is obtained at x = 0.01. The results show that the change of the doping content of ScE^{3+} affects the B-O bond strength and the degree of BO6 octahedron distortion. (a\u2013g) illustrates dielectric properties of BFScx-BT (x = 0\u20130.02) ceramics from 30 \xb0C to 550 \xb0C at different frequencies. As the content of ScE^{3+} increases, the dielectric peak shows a slight broadening, suggesting a slight enhancement of relaxor-like behavior, which aligns with the results obtained from Raman analysis. To further quantify the relaxor-like behavior, the diffuseness coefficient \u03b3 was calculated based on the modified Curie-Weiss law:  For typical ferroelectrics, \u03b3 is approximately 1, while for relaxor ferroelectrics, \u03b3 approaches 2. The ln(1/\u03b5r-1/\u03b5m) versus ln(T-Tm) curves for all compositions are shown in the inset of (a\u2013g). The values of \u03b3 gradually increase from 1.54 to 1.63 as x varies from 0 to 0.02, as depicted in (h). This slightly increased \u03b3 indicates that the relaxor-like behavior is marginally enhanced with the introduction of ScE^{3+}. The slightly increased relaxor-like behavior is attributed to the larger ionic radius of ScE^{3+} compared to FeE^{3+} ions, resulting in the emergence of local polar disordering when ScE^{3+} substitutes for FeE^{3+}. At the same time, it can be observed that the dielectric loss of the BFScx-BT ceramics increases significantly, reaching the order of 10E^{2} when the temperature is up to 400 \xb0C. However, there is a significant reduction in the dielectric loss when ScE^{3+} is doped into of the ceramic systems, which will be discussed later. We also found that with the doping of ScE^{3+}, the dielectric maximum temperature lightly decreases from 530 \xb0C to 511 \xb0C in (h), indicating that the high ferroelectric-to-paraelectric phase transition temperature of the ceramics could be maintained. (a) demonstrates the polarization-electric field (P-E) hysteresis loops of BFScx-BT ceramics. To better understand the influence of ScE^{3+} doping on the ferroelectric properties of BFScx-BT ceramics, the maximum polarization (Pmax), remanent polarization (Pr), and coercive field (Ec) were obtained from (a) and summarized as functions of ScE^{3+} content in (b). However, a slight decrease in Ps and Pr is observed at x = 0.005, which may attribute to the sudden drop in relative density at this composition, as indicated in. The maximum values of 2Pr (40.8 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}) and 2Pmax (55.0 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}) are achieved in the BFSc0.01-BT ceramic. The greater BO6 octahedral distortion generated by ScE^{3+} doping contributes to the larger structural asymmetry. This greatly enhances the intrinsic response and inherently contributes to the macroscopic ferroelectric properties of BFScx-BT ceramics. Moreover, the variation in the coercive field (Ec) with the addition of ScE^{3+} may be attributed not only to the high degree of lattice distortion but also to changes in grain size. This grain size effect is particularly relevant in BiFeO3-BaTiO3 ceramics and contributes to the observed changes in Ec with ScE^{3+} doping. The variation of piezoelectric response, \u03b5r and \u03b5r\xd7 Pr for BFScx-BT ceramics as a function of composition is depicted in. The d33 displays a trend that increases firstly and then decreases with the addition of ScE^{3+}. At x = 0.01, The best piezoelectric properties (d33\u223c163 pC/N) are acquired, with a high temperature (Tc\u223c518 \xb0C) as in. In general, the d33 coefficient is determined by the equation : with \u03b50 denoting the permittivity of free space and Q33 representing the electrostriction coefficient. It can be seen that there is a slight decrease in the value of \u03b5r from x = 0 to x = 0.02. However, it is noteworthy that the \u03b5r\xd7 Pr initially increases and then decreases, and exhibits the highest value when x = 0.01, which is consistent with the d33 values. Therefore, the observed enhancement in the d33 value can be primarily attributed to the increased polarization resulting from the greater asymmetry in the crystal structure. Magnetic property is also important for the ME effect of the BFScx-BT ceramics. (a) shows the M \u2212 H hysteresis loops of the compositions with different ScE^{3+} doping concentrations at room temperature. The saturation magnetization Ms, remnant magnetization Mr and coercive field Hc obtained from the M \u2212 H hysteresis loops are plotted in (b). With the increase of ScE^{3+} content, Ms reaches its maximum value of 0.14 emu/g at x = 0.01, while Mr remains essentially unchanged. The Jahn\u2013Teller effect reveals the fact that the BO6 octahedral distortion will break the local cycloidal spin structure and also result in the varying magnetization. The vary I(E\u22127)/I(A1-4) in (c) suggests the greatest distortion of the BO6 octahedra in BFSc0.01-BT ceramics, which generates the intense ferrimagnetism. The ScE^{3+} substitution simultaneously increases the piezoelectricity and ferromagnetism of BFScx-BT ceramics, potentially leading to a further improvement in the ME response. (c) illustrates the frequency dependence of the magnetoelectric coupling coefficient (\u03b1ME) of BFScx-BT (x = 0, 0.01, 0.02) ceramics, measured under a DC bias magnetic field of 6000 Oe. The figure reveals \u03b1ME peaks in the frequency range of 60\u2013100 kHz, which occurs because the amplitude of vibration is amplified near the mechanical resonance frequency, leading to an enhanced magnetoelectric response, as evidenced by the observation of the resonance and antiresonance peaks in the frequency ranges on the impedance spectra [shown in the inset of (c)]. For instance, with x = 0, \u03b1ME measured under a 6000 Oe DC magnetic field increases from approximately 50 mV/(cm\xb7Oe) below 70 kHz to around 465 mV/(cm\xb7Oe) at resonant frequencies. Finally, ScE^{3+} doping boosts the magnetoelectric response of the systems, increasing the peak \u03b1ME at the resonant frequency from \u223c465 mV/(cm\xb7Oe) at x = 0\u2013\u223c567 mV/(cm\xb7Oe) at x = 0.01. However, when ScE^{3+} doping is further increased to x = 0.02, a deterioration in both piezoelectric and magnetic properties lead to a subsequent decrease in the peak \u03b1ME, as shown in (c\u2013d). A summary of the magnetoelectric coupling coefficient for BiFeO3-based single-phase materials has been provided in. Based on the above analysis, the rare earth elements are proven to provides an effective approach for further enhancing the ME response of BF-BT-based ceramics. From , we can see that the dielectric loss of undoped BF-BT ceramics is suppressed by ScE^{3+} doping. The reduction of dielectric loss can be more clearly seen in (a), in which the temperature dependence of dielectric loss (tan \u03b4) (at 1 kHz) measured in BF-BT and BFSc0.01-BT ceramics is compared. As the temperature increased, the dielectric loss of the x = 0 sample exhibits a rapid rise, reaching approximately 2.5 at 200 \xb0C. In contrast, the x = 0.01 ceramics show a significantly lower loss, approximately 0.3 at 200 \xb0C. The resistivity of the compositions (x = 0, 0.01), as a function of temperature, is shown in. In the measured temperature range, the resistivity of BFSc0.01-BT consistently surpasses that of BF-BT, particularly at room temperature, where the resistance of BFSc0.01-BT is approximately an order of magnitude higher than that of the undoped BF-BT samples. Because the bandgap energy (Eg) of BiScO3 (>2.59eV) is larger than that of BiFeO3 (\u223c2.17eV), we speculate that the introduction of ScE^{3+} in BF-BT widens of the energy gap, leading to a decrease in conductivity. We measured the UV\u2013vis spectra of BF-BT and BFSc0.01-BT samples and the results are shown in. The Eg value can be calculated using the relationship: where \u03b1 is absorption coefficient, h is Planck's constant, and \u03bd is frequency. From the results, we can see that Eg of BFSc0.01-BT exceeds that of BF-BT by approximately 0.12 eV, which shows that ScE^{3+} substitution could effectively widen bandgap energy illustrated in (d). Moreover, in BF-based ceramics, it has been reported that the presence of defect dipoles generated by a change of FeE^{3+} to FeE^{2+}/FeE^{4+} transitions and a loss of Bi2O3 during sintering can cause a large leakage current and poor insulation performance. The XPS spectra for BF-BT and BFSc0.01-BT samples, as well as peak fitting for O1s and Fe2p elements, are shown in (a\u2013d). The peaks of Fe2p1/2 and Fe2p3/2 can be fitted into two sub-peaks, respectively. The fitted sub-peaks located at 709.4 eV and 722.9 eV can be assigned to FeE^{2+}, and 710.6 eV and 724.1 eV to FeE^{3+}, and 712.2 eV and 725.7 eV to FeE^{4+}. At the same time, O1s peak is fitted into three sub-peaks, corresponding to lattice oxygen OL at 529.3 eV, oxygen vacancies OV at 530.6 eV and oxygen due to surface adsorbates OAbs (or carbon-oxygen bond) at 531.6 eV. By introducing ScE^{3+}, there is a substantial rise in the FeE^{3+} content in BFSc0.01-BT ceramic compared with the undoped BF-BT sample [shown in (e\u2013f)]. It can be also observed that ScE^{3+} doping causes a marked reduction in the oxygen vacancy content. The doping of ScE^{3+} probably breaks the electron transfer path of adjacent FeE^{3+}, inhibiting the production of FeE^{2+} ions and the creation of oxygen vacancies.

# TITLE
Enhanced magnetoelectric response in Sc-doped BiFeO<inf>3</inf>-BaTiO<inf>3</inf> Ceramics

# ABSTRACT
In recent years, the single-phase BiFeO3-BaTiO3 multiferroic ceramics have gained attention for their magnetoelectric response above room temperature, but substantial endeavors to improve the property have yielded modest results. An optimized BiFe(1-x)ScxO3-BaTiO3 composition having magnetoelectric coefficient (αME) ∼ 567 mV/(cm·Oe)) measured at the resonant frequency (∼95 kHz) is reported in this work. The high αME is attributed to the combined effect of improved piezoelectric coefficient and enhanced ferromagnetism. Besides, the addition of Sc3+ can exhibit increased resistivity and reduced defect dipole effects, which is conducive to improving electric properties.

# INTRODUCTION
The couple between them manifests rich physical phenomena such as magnetoelectric (ME) effect, spin-orbit coupling effect and anomalous valley Hall effect. Notably, ME effect can realize the regulation of electric polarization by magnetic fields or magnetic moments by electric fields, and has garnered increasing interest due to its potential applications in spintronics, multi-state memory, and low-field magnetic sensors. To date, researchers have studied various single-phase ME materials, including BiFeO3, TbMnO3, BaMnF4, and Mn3B7O13X (M = Mn, Ni, Co; X = Cl, Br, I). However, most of these materials exhibit low ferroelectric or magnetic transition temperatures, lacking the ME effect at room temperature. Among a few single-phase multiferroics, BiFeO3 (BFO) possesses a rhombohedral distorted perovskite structure and has garnered increasing attention due to its coexistence of ferroelectricity (Curie temperature TC \u223c 1103K) and antiferromagnetism (N\xe9el temperature TN \u223c 643K) above room temperature, rendering it promising for multiferroic device applications. However, it also suffers from several inevitable drawbacks including high leakage current (Bi volatility and presence of impurity phases) and weak ferromagnetism , resulting in low ME effect. It was reported that introducing ABO3 perovskites (BaTiO3 , SrTiO3 , CaTiO3 , PbTiO3 , etc.) into a solid solution with BiFeO3 seems an effective way to suppress the formation of parasitical phases like Bi2Fe4O9 or Bi25FeO39, and improve the electric properties. In BiFeO3-BaTiO3 system, the substitution of BiFeO3 by BaTiO3 has been found to be a strategy to improve ME effect , however, acquiring the large ME effect still remains a pressing issue. Recently it was shown that the substitution of rare earth elements could effectively improve multiferroic performance of BF-BT ceramics. For example, A-site substitution using rare earth elements (La, Sm, or Nd) could suppress the dielectric loss and modify the polarization response in BF-BT system. B-site substitution of FeE^{3+} by rare earth elements (such as Sc, Te, Ga etc.) was found to improve the magnetization due to the enhanced ferromagnetic interaction between magnetic ions in BF as well as in BF-BT systems. Noteworthy studies by Kim et al. have demonstrated the effect of ScE^{3+} doping and revealed enhanced piezoelectric responses in 0.67BiFeO3\u20130.33BaTiO3-xBiScO3. This improvement is primarily attributed to the fact that the ScE^{3+} cation is electrically more stable than FeE^{3+}, which enhances the system's resistivity and ensures the fully realized polarization process, thereby promoting increased piezoelectric performance. Additionally, since the ScE^{3+} ion lacks unpaired d electrons, it cannot form antiferromagnetic coupling with FeE^{3+} ions, thereby releasing the latent magnetization trapped within the structure, leading to ferromagnetic behavior. Wu et al. demonstrated enhanced ferromagnetism in La and Sc co-doped BiFeO3 through the doping-induced structural distortion and the destruction of the antimagnetic ordering. Therefore, it is desired to evaluate the effects of rare Sc substitution on the ME response of BF-BT system. In this paper, we prepare the 0.725BiFe(1-x)ScxO3-0.275BaTiO3 ceramics (abbreviated as BFScx-BT, x = 0\u20130.02) via a solid-state reaction method, and investigate thoroughly the structural evolution, electrical properties, ferromagnetism and ME effect of the compositions. Eventually, the BFSc0.01-BT component realizes a relatively high d33 of 163 pC/N along with a high Curie temperature (518 \xb0C), while enhancing the ferromagnetism to a certain extent. Furthermore, an elevated magnetoelectric coupling coefficient (\u03b1ME\u223c567 mV/(cm\xb7Oe)) is achieved. Further analysis of high-temperature resistivity, ultraviolet\u2013visible photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) elucidates the physical mechanisms related to the reduction in leakage current.

# CONCLUSION
We systematically investigate the influence of ScE^{3+} doping on the microstructure, electric properties, ferromagnetic properties and ME effect of BFScx-BT ceramics. The XRD pattern shows that all the compositions exhibit perovskite structure with the coexistence of rhombohedral and tetragonal symmetries. Raman spectroscopy indicates that ScE^{3+} doping significantly increases the BO6 octahedral distortions of the compositions, which contribute to the enhancement of spontaneous polarization and the piezoelectric constant d33. The maximum 2Pr (40.7 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}) and the optimum d33 (163 pC/N) were achieved at x = 0.01, whereas the Curie temperature TC is 518 \xb0C, while the ferromagnetic properties are also enhanced to some extent. Conclusively, the peak \u03b1ME reaches its optimum value (\u223c567 mV/(cm\xb7Oe)) at the resonant frequency (\u223c95 kHz) in BFSc0.01-BT ceramics. Furthermore, the addition of ScE^{3+} could also increase the bandgap of this composition and suppress the generation of defects, significantly improving the resistivity.
