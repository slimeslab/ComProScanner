# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
As depicted in a, the synthesis of CS involves a two-step hydrothermal process. Initially, one-dimensional CdS nanorods with a diameter of approximately 500 nm were synthesized using conventional methods (, Supporting Information, SI). Subsequently, the lamellar SnS2 is uniformly synthesized on the pre-existing 1D CdS nanorods owing to electrostatic interactions. The formation of a core-shell structure is clearly demonstrated in b\u2013c and (SI), wherein CdS microrods are encapsulated by SnS2 nanoplates with a perpendicular growth of 40 nm height on their entire surface. Besides, the specific surface area of CS-2 is measured to be 13.72 mE^{2} gE^{\u22121}, which is higher than that of CdS (2.27 mE^{2} gE^{\u22121}), SnS2 (5.17 mE^{2} gE^{\u22121}), and RCS (9.00 mE^{2} gE^{\u22121}). As shown in d, the lattice fringes in both vertical nanoflakes and nanorods accurately match with the (002) plane of hexagonal SnS2 and the (001) plane of CdS, which have interplanar spacings measuring d = 0.295 nm and 0.358 nm, respectively. Significantly, CS-2 exhibits a noticeable proximity between SnS2 and CdS at the interface, while RCS forms a clear boundary, suggesting that the CS-2 facilitates efficient charge transfer across the interphase. Moreover, the presence of a significant amount of residual stress on the surface of SnS2 is clearly evident from the pronounced changes in lattice spacing and structural disorder (d). In contrast, the RCS sample showed negligible lattice dislocation. (SI) demonstrates distinct EPR signals at g = 2.005 for CS-2, which can be attributed to the presence of sulfur vacancies on the surface , suggesting that CS-2 possesses surface sulfur vacancies. Furthermore, CS-2 exhibits more sulfur vacancies compared to RCS, making it easier to expose uncoordinated active sites for molecular activation. As depicted in e\u2013h, the central nanorods exhibit a predominant concentration of the Cd element, whereas the surface nanosheets predominantly display a distribution of the Sn element, implying the emergence of a core-shell morphology. To further confirm the surface residual stress, geometric phase analysis (GPA) has been carried out. As displayed in , the SnS2 edge in CS-2 exhibits a relatively significant tensile stress effect compared to RCS, while internal strain can be observed in the CdS, indicating the presence of tensile strain on the surface of CS-2, which helps to induce macroscopic polarization and the piezoelectric response of the catalysts. As depicted in , all the prepared materials exhibits stronger CdS diffraction peaks and weaker SnS2 phases, which can be attributed to the low amount or low crystallinity of SnS2 , indicating the successful formation of a CdS/SnS2 (CS) heterojunction. As depicted in , two peaks at 305 and 603 cmE^{\u22121} correspond to the E1 and 2E1 vibrational modes of CdS. Additionally, the peak at 319 cmE^{\u22121} is attributed to the A1g phonon vibrational mode of Sn\u2013S bond. Obviously, the Sn\u2013S bonds indicate a shift towards lower wavelengths suggests significant tensile stress in the SnS2 edge in CS-2. As shown in j, the binding energys at 405.1 and 411.9 eV were related to Cd 3d5/2 and Cd 3d3/2, respectively. Furthermore, two peaks at 486.4 and 494.8 eV could be assigned to Sn 3d5/2 and Sn 3d3/2, respectively (k). The high-resolution S 2p peaks at 161.3 eV and 162.6 eV are ascribed to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2, respectively . By comparing the characteristic peaks of pure CdS and SnS2, we can observe a slight shift towards higher and lower energies in the binding energies of Cd 3d and Sn 3d for CS-2, suggesting that electrons flow from CdS to SnS2 in CS-2. Piezo-photocatalytic reduction of NO3 E^{\u2212} to NH3 was successfully achieved under ambient conditions without the need for a hole sacrificial agent or cocatalyst. The concentrations of NH4 E^{+}, NO3 E^{\u2212} and other by-products were determined using a variety of methods, including E^{1}H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, Nessler's reagent method, cation chromatography and gas chromatography. As displayed in a and , the photocatalytic average NH3 production rates of CdS, SnS2, RCS, CS-1, CS-2, CS-3, and CS-4 are 0.32, 0.46, 1.01, 1.82, 4.32, 2.56 and 2.13 mmol gE^{\u22121} hE^{\u22121}, respectively. Notably, CS-2 displayed the highest NH3 formation rate, surpassing CdS and SnS2 by 13.5 and 9.39 times, respectively. Besides, CS-2 maintains a the highest NH3 selectivity (95.2 %) (b). To further assess the light utilization efficiency of CS-2, we measured its apparent quantum yield (AQY) under monochromatic light exposure. As shown in d and , CS-2 achieves a maximum AQY of 8.87 %, surpassing the majority of previously reported photocatalysts in both pure water conditions and under no sacrificial agent environment. As shown in a and (SI), the piezocatalytic NH3 formation rates of CdS, SnS2, RCS, CS-1, CS-2, CS-3, and CS-4 are 0.07, 0.09, 0.12, 0.18, 0.29, 0.26, and 0.23 mmol gE^{\u22121} hE^{\u22121}, respectively. Interestingly, the piezo-photocatalytic NH3 formation rates over CdS, SnS2, RCS, CS-1, CS-2, CS-3, and CS-4 are 0.40, 0.83, 1.21, 2.14, 7.99, 3.59, and 2.90 mmol gE^{\u22121} hE^{\u22121}, respectively. Additionally, CS-2 exhibits an enhanced selectivity of 96.1 %, while demonstrating negligible formation of other harmful by-products (NO2 E^{\u2212} or NO). Notably, the piezo-photocatalytic NH3 production rates of CS-2 are 1.85 and 27.55 times than those photocatalysis and piezocatalysis, respectively, indicating that the presence of piezoelectric polarization plays a crucial role in boosting photocatalytic efficiency. As shown in e, it can be confirmed that the generated NH4 E^{+} originated from the supplied NO3 E^{\u2212} rather than internal or external nitrogen sources. In addition, we conducted further investigations on the durability of CS-2 under different conditions. As displayed in f and , even after undergoing ten cycles and long-term operation, CS-2 maintained a high NH3 yield under various conditions, indicating the stability of CS-2. Additionally, there are negligible changes were observed in the SEM, XRD and XPS after the reaction (, SI), confirming the sustained stability of its application. Furthermore, we have also verified the other half of the oxidation reaction by conducting electron capture experiments. illustrates a significant increase in the rate of O2 production, indicating that the photogenerated holes on the CS-2 surface facilitate the oxidation of OHE^{\u2212} ions into O2 molecules. The UV\u2013vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) technique was employed to evaluate the optical characteristics of the CS catalyst. For , the absorption band of pure SnS2 and CdS samples are observed at approximately 700 nm and 530 nm, respectively, while the CS composites fall within this wavelength range. Therefore, the respective band gap values for SnS2 and CdS can be identified as 2.09 eV and 2.35 eV , respectively. In addition, based on the Mott-Schottky plots  , we determined that SnS2 and CdS have conduction band potentials of \u22120.66 V and \u22120.61 V (vs NHE), respectively. Therefore, the valence band potentials of SnS2 and CdS can be determined as 1.43 and 1.74 V, respectively. Gratifyingly, the band structures of CdS and SnS2 meet the requirements for NO3 E^{\u2212} reduction and water decomposition to generate oxygen. The utilization of the piezoelectric response force microscope (PFM) aims to enhance the understanding of the piezoelectric characteristics of CS samples. For a\u2013c and , the morphology of CS-2 displayed a rod-like structure with directional flake formations, which is in harmony with the relative amplitude images and phase transition signal images, suggesting the excellent local piezoelectric response. Interestingly, the CS-2 material exhibits a dispersion of phase inversion and charge distribution on its outer layer, while other factors are concentrated within the material. This observation suggests that the leaves of CS-2 experience maximum stress, leading to significant deformation of constituent atoms. All the prepared catalysts exhibited both the characteristic hysteresis loops of phase-voltage (\u223c180\xb0) and butterfly-shaped curves of amplitude-voltage (d and ), providing evidence for the inherent piezoelectric properties. As a result, it was determined that CS-2 exhibited a significantly higher piezoelectric coefficient (d33) of 3.11 p.m./V (e), which is approximately 1.39 times greater than that of RCS (2.24 p.m./V). To further confirm the disparity in piezoelectric potential between CS-2 and RCS, we utilized COMSOL Multiphysics software to simulate the pressure distribution. On the contrary, the leaves of CS-2 experience maximum stress ( f), which is harmony with the PFM results, resulting in a high proportion of constituent atoms being deformed. This leads to a significant increase in surface polarizability , which is confirmed by the Polarization\u2013electric field (P\u2013E) hysteresis loops. On the other hand, the presence of significant residual stress on the surface of SnS2 results in an expansion of the surface lattice spacing and an increase in structural disorder. As shown in , the average lifetime (\u03c4) of charges for CS-2 is 0.77 ns, which is significantly longer than that of RCS (0.60 ns), SnS2 (0.45 ns), and CdS (0.26 ns). As shown in , CS-2 exhibits a significant improvement in photocurrent density compared to pure CdS, SnS2, and RCS, indicating an enhanced efficiency in charge carrier separation due to its macroscopic polarization at the surface. Additionally, EIS analysis and steady-state fluorescence were performed on the prepared samples. shows that the arc radius of CS-2 is comparatively smaller under different condition, which aligns with the PL results  and indicates an enhanced efficiency in charge carrier separation for the stress acting on the surface. In order to further confirm the underlying charge transfer, in situ XPS has been conducted. illustrates that the electron density of the Cd 3d and Sn 3d spectra in CS-2 shifts towards higher and lower energies upon exposure to light, respectively. This provides direct evidence of charge carrier migration from CdS to SnS2. Besides, the work function values for the pure CdS and SnS2 were approximately 5.71 eV and 5.88 eV , respectively, further suggesting that the photo-induced electrons in CdS can spontaneously migrate towards SnS2 at the heterojunction interface in order to establish equilibrium in the Fermi level. Therefore, charge rearrangement between phases in a heterojunction creates a potential difference, leading to the formation of a built-in electric field (BIEF). In addition, the BIEF of CS-2 was measured in both dark and light conditions using KPFM. In g\u2013h and (SI), the surface potential of CS-2 decreases from 125.8 mV to 104.5 mV after exposure to light, while the RCS decreases from 61.5 mV to 52.3 mV. These results can be attributed to the existence of an intrinsic electric field and dipoles generated by charge transfer within CS-2, which lead to a partial reduction in piezo-induced polarization charge due to photo-generated carriers. It is evident that there is an electron transfer from CdS to SnS2 at the heterojunction interface, resulting in an accumulation of holes on CdS. In contrast to RCS, CS-2 displays a more concentrated center of charge, which can be attributed to the stress structure associated with the surface, enhancing material polarization and thereby intensifies charge separation even further. Above all, the presence of significant residual stress on the surface of SnS2 leads to a dispersion of local stress concentrations, resulting in deformation of a substantial number of constituent atoms. To enhance our comprehension of the reaction mechanism, we employed in situ FTIR spectroscopy to examine the reduction process of NO3 E^{\u2212}. In a, the broad peaks around 3000\u20133700 cmE^{\u22121} are associated with the adsorption of \u2217N/\u2217NH/\u2217NH2/\u2217NH3. Besides, the presence of intermediate products \u2217NO, \u2217NO2, \u2217NH, and NH2 was detected at 1560, 1340, 1260, and 1150 cmE^{\u22121}. Importantly, the raw materials and products of NO3 E^{\u2212} and NH4 E^{+} exhibited peaks at 1405 and 1450 cmE^{\u22121}, respectively. Notably, the increased characteristic peak at 1640 cmE^{\u22121} is attributed to the bending vibration of the adsorbed H2O , indicating that residual stress on the surface of SnS2 enhances the exposure of surface microenvironment for H absorption. Based on the findings and relevant literature, we propose a gradual transformation of CS-2 into NH3 through a series of adsorption steps: \u2217NO3 \u2192 \u2217NO2OH \u2192 \u2217NO2 \u2192 \u2217NOOH \u2192 \u2217NO \u2192 \u2217NOH \u2192 \u2217N \u2192 \u2217NH \u2192 \u2217NH2 \u2192 \u2217NH3. Our findings suggest that exposure to light or ultrasound leads to a shift towards higher wavenumbers in the Sn\u2013S bonds of CS-2, indicating the release of residual stress on the surface of SnS2 and resulting in dynamic reconstruction. Shortening the Sn\u2013S bond length not only augments local electron density but also enhances adsorption molecule-surface interaction, leading to more stable adsorption. To explore the mechanism of adsorption activation, we employed a contact angle to monitor the initial stages of the PPNR primary reaction process. illustrate that CS-2 displays a reduced contact angle in both aqueous and nitrate solutions, indicating that the surface of SnS2 experiences lower residual stress, thereby creating an optimal microenvironment for the interaction between surface hydrogen and reactants. To investigate the impact of \u2217H on the PPNR process, a \u2217H quenching experiment was conducted by introducing tertiary butanol (TBA). As depicted in b, CS-2 exhibited a significant reduction in the rate of NH3 production, suggesting the CS-2 provided a large number of active hydrogen sites. To further confirm the H adsorption capacity, DFT calculations has been carried out. As shown in c, the Gibbs free energy values for \u2217H over CS-2, RCS, SnS2, and CdS, are observed to be \u22121.03 eV, \u22120.91 eV, \u22120.87 eV, and \u22120.23 eV, respectively, indicating that the presence of a loose structure promotes favorable adsorption of \u2217H. As we know, the adsorption of NO3 E^{\u2212} on the catalyst surface is considered to be the initial deoxidation step determines the rate of reaction. To determine the initial activation state of nitric acid, DFT calculations have been conducted. As depicted in d, the Gibbs free energy linked to \u2217NO3 within CS-2, RCS, SnS2, and CdS exhibits values of \u22122.38, \u22121.58, \u22121.53, and \u22121.12 eV, implying that residual stress present on the surface of SnS2 enhances the availability of active sites for NO3 E^{\u2212} adsorption. Furthermore, the application of external pressure can further decrease the activation energy of the reaction, indicating that under external stress, the surface of SnS2 will experience enhanced reconstruction and expose more active sites. Significantly, the charge discrepancies observed at the adsorption sites of O and N in CS-2, RCS, CdS, and SnS2 were found to be \u22120.56 |e|, \u22120.25 |e|, \u22120.20 |e|, and \u22120.12 |e|, respectively (e and , SI). The presence of residual stress on the surface of SnS2 leads to changes in lattice spacing and an increase in structural disorder, resulting in polarization and uneven charge distribution at the active site. Under stress, the charge differences on the CS-2 and RCS increased to \u22120.58 |e| and \u22120.29 |e| (f and , SI), respectively. This suggests that the external stress induced structural changes, leading to enhanced electronic coupling for the NO3 E^{\u2212} adsorption and activation. As shown in d and S35\u201338 (SI), the reduction of Gibbs free energy for hydrogenation of \u2217NO3 to \u2217NO2OH is observed in CS-2, RCS, CdS, and SnS2 is reduced to the \u22121.65, 1.31, \u22120.95, and \u22121.22 eV, respectively, indicating the challenging nature of NO3 E^{\u2212} surface hydrogenation. However, in CS-2, this step of \u2217NO2 \u2192 \u2217NO2H and \u2217NO \u2192 \u2217NOH to be facile, indicating the need to optimize intermediate adsorption and simultaneously generate a substantial supply of H\u2217 for efficient deep deoxygenation of N-containing intermediates, thus helping impede the production of nitrogen oxides. Notably, the hydrogenation steps from \u2217N \u2192 \u2217NH \u2192 \u2217NH2 exhibit an endothermic process in terms of Gibbs free energy. Moreover, external influences can effectively reduce the adsorption energy of the intermediate by inducing dynamic reconstruction of the SnS2 surface under external stress.

# INTRODUCTION
Ammonia (NH3) is of utmost importance as a fundamental raw material in the manufacturing processes of diverse chemicals, including fertilizers, synthetic fibers, and pharmaceuticals. Currently, the industrial production of NH3 heavily relies on the energy-intensive Haber-Bosch process, resulting in a detrimental impact on the environment. Recently, the photocatalytic reduction of nitrate (NO3 E^{\u2212}) has garnered significant attention due to its low bond dissociation energy and the remarkable solubility of NO3 E^{\u2212}. Moreover, the increasing presence of NO3 E^{\u2212} in water sources has resulted in disruptions to the ecological system and poses potential risks to both public health and environmental stability. Therefore, the simultaneous attainment of environmental and energy objectives can be achieved by employing photocatalytic nitrate reduction to produce valuable NH3. Therefore, the integration of piezocatalysis and photocatalysis (PPNR) is expected to result in a significant advancement in the conversion of nitrates into valuable NH3. Notably, wurtzite CdS with a unique noncentro-symmetric structure has garnered considerable interest in the fields of piezo-photocatalysis and NO3 E^{\u2212} reduction. For example, SnS2, known for its large specific surface area, high strain response, and abundant active sites, holds great promise as a potential candidate for constructing heterojunctions to enhance piezo-photocatalytic activity. In this study, we have successfully prepared a precise and adjustable surface macroscopic polarization by incorporating SnS2 nanoplates onto 1D CdS nanorods (CS) through a two-step hydrothermal process. Experimental results demonstrate that the presence of significant residual stress on the surface of SnS2 leads to the dispersion of local stress concentrations, which results in the deformation of a substantial number of surface constituent atoms, leading to an increase in both surface structural disorder and macroscopic polarization. Additionally, the macroscopic polarization of the surface structure induces dynamic reconstruction to expose numerous active sites, creating an advantageous microenvironment for the interaction between surface H and NO3 E^{\u2212} ions, which facilitates electron accumulation and promotes polarity interactions as well as regulates the adsorption energy of intermediates. Impressively, the optimized CS-2 exhibited an excellent NH4 E^{+} production rate of 7.99 mmol gE^{\u22121} hE^{\u22121} without using a sacrificial agent or cocatalyst, which is 114 times greater than that of CdS.

# CONCLUSION
In summary, a novel method has been meticulously constructed to enhance the overall surface macroscopic polarization by incorporating SnS2 nanoplates onto 1D CdS nanorods, resulting in the formation of a uniformly distributed surface tensile strain in the traditional piezoelectric heterojunction. DFT results and experimental findings suggest that these structural configurations lead to an increase in structural disorder and dynamic reconfiguration, which exacerbates overall polarization and uneven charge distribution, facilitating efficient charge transfer. Moreover, the synergistic combination of surface strain structure and piezoelectric effect induces dynamic reconstruction, creating an optimal microenvironment for the interaction between surface hydrogen (H) and nitrate (NO3 E^{\u2212}) ions. Fortunately, the optimized CS-2 exhibited an excellent NH4 E^{+} production rate of 7.99 mmol gE^{\u22121} hE^{\u22121} without using a sacrificial agent or cocatalyst, which is 114 times greater than that of CdS.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
As depicted in a, the synthesis of CS involves a two-step hydrothermal process. Initially, one-dimensional CdS nanorods with a diameter of approximately 500 nm were synthesized using conventional methods (, Supporting Information, SI). Subsequently, the lamellar SnS2 is uniformly synthesized on the pre-existing 1D CdS nanorods owing to electrostatic interactions. The formation of a core-shell structure is clearly demonstrated in b\u2013c and (SI), wherein CdS microrods are encapsulated by SnS2 nanoplates with a perpendicular growth of 40 nm height on their entire surface. Besides, the specific surface area of CS-2 is measured to be 13.72 mE^{2} gE^{\u22121}, which is higher than that of CdS (2.27 mE^{2} gE^{\u22121}), SnS2 (5.17 mE^{2} gE^{\u22121}), and RCS (9.00 mE^{2} gE^{\u22121}). As shown in d, the lattice fringes in both vertical nanoflakes and nanorods accurately match with the (002) plane of hexagonal SnS2 and the (001) plane of CdS, which have interplanar spacings measuring d = 0.295 nm and 0.358 nm, respectively. Significantly, CS-2 exhibits a noticeable proximity between SnS2 and CdS at the interface, while RCS forms a clear boundary, suggesting that the CS-2 facilitates efficient charge transfer across the interphase. Moreover, the presence of a significant amount of residual stress on the surface of SnS2 is clearly evident from the pronounced changes in lattice spacing and structural disorder (d). In contrast, the RCS sample showed negligible lattice dislocation. (SI) demonstrates distinct EPR signals at g = 2.005 for CS-2, which can be attributed to the presence of sulfur vacancies on the surface , suggesting that CS-2 possesses surface sulfur vacancies. Furthermore, CS-2 exhibits more sulfur vacancies compared to RCS, making it easier to expose uncoordinated active sites for molecular activation. As depicted in e\u2013h, the central nanorods exhibit a predominant concentration of the Cd element, whereas the surface nanosheets predominantly display a distribution of the Sn element, implying the emergence of a core-shell morphology. To further confirm the surface residual stress, geometric phase analysis (GPA) has been carried out. As displayed in , the SnS2 edge in CS-2 exhibits a relatively significant tensile stress effect compared to RCS, while internal strain can be observed in the CdS, indicating the presence of tensile strain on the surface of CS-2, which helps to induce macroscopic polarization and the piezoelectric response of the catalysts. As depicted in , all the prepared materials exhibits stronger CdS diffraction peaks and weaker SnS2 phases, which can be attributed to the low amount or low crystallinity of SnS2 , indicating the successful formation of a CdS/SnS2 (CS) heterojunction. As depicted in , two peaks at 305 and 603 cmE^{\u22121} correspond to the E1 and 2E1 vibrational modes of CdS. Additionally, the peak at 319 cmE^{\u22121} is attributed to the A1g phonon vibrational mode of Sn\u2013S bond. Obviously, the Sn\u2013S bonds indicate a shift towards lower wavelengths suggests significant tensile stress in the SnS2 edge in CS-2. As shown in j, the binding energys at 405.1 and 411.9 eV were related to Cd 3d5/2 and Cd 3d3/2, respectively. Furthermore, two peaks at 486.4 and 494.8 eV could be assigned to Sn 3d5/2 and Sn 3d3/2, respectively (k). The high-resolution S 2p peaks at 161.3 eV and 162.6 eV are ascribed to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2, respectively . By comparing the characteristic peaks of pure CdS and SnS2, we can observe a slight shift towards higher and lower energies in the binding energies of Cd 3d and Sn 3d for CS-2, suggesting that electrons flow from CdS to SnS2 in CS-2. Piezo-photocatalytic reduction of NO3 E^{\u2212} to NH3 was successfully achieved under ambient conditions without the need for a hole sacrificial agent or cocatalyst. The concentrations of NH4 E^{+}, NO3 E^{\u2212} and other by-products were determined using a variety of methods, including E^{1}H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, Nessler's reagent method, cation chromatography and gas chromatography. As displayed in a and , the photocatalytic average NH3 production rates of CdS, SnS2, RCS, CS-1, CS-2, CS-3, and CS-4 are 0.32, 0.46, 1.01, 1.82, 4.32, 2.56 and 2.13 mmol gE^{\u22121} hE^{\u22121}, respectively. Notably, CS-2 displayed the highest NH3 formation rate, surpassing CdS and SnS2 by 13.5 and 9.39 times, respectively. Besides, CS-2 maintains a the highest NH3 selectivity (95.2 %) (b). To further assess the light utilization efficiency of CS-2, we measured its apparent quantum yield (AQY) under monochromatic light exposure. As shown in d and , CS-2 achieves a maximum AQY of 8.87 %, surpassing the majority of previously reported photocatalysts in both pure water conditions and under no sacrificial agent environment. As shown in a and (SI), the piezocatalytic NH3 formation rates of CdS, SnS2, RCS, CS-1, CS-2, CS-3, and CS-4 are 0.07, 0.09, 0.12, 0.18, 0.29, 0.26, and 0.23 mmol gE^{\u22121} hE^{\u22121}, respectively. Interestingly, the piezo-photocatalytic NH3 formation rates over CdS, SnS2, RCS, CS-1, CS-2, CS-3, and CS-4 are 0.40, 0.83, 1.21, 2.14, 7.99, 3.59, and 2.90 mmol gE^{\u22121} hE^{\u22121}, respectively. Additionally, CS-2 exhibits an enhanced selectivity of 96.1 %, while demonstrating negligible formation of other harmful by-products (NO2 E^{\u2212} or NO). Notably, the piezo-photocatalytic NH3 production rates of CS-2 are 1.85 and 27.55 times than those photocatalysis and piezocatalysis, respectively, indicating that the presence of piezoelectric polarization plays a crucial role in boosting photocatalytic efficiency. As shown in e, it can be confirmed that the generated NH4 E^{+} originated from the supplied NO3 E^{\u2212} rather than internal or external nitrogen sources. In addition, we conducted further investigations on the durability of CS-2 under different conditions. As displayed in f and , even after undergoing ten cycles and long-term operation, CS-2 maintained a high NH3 yield under various conditions, indicating the stability of CS-2. Additionally, there are negligible changes were observed in the SEM, XRD and XPS after the reaction (, SI), confirming the sustained stability of its application. Furthermore, we have also verified the other half of the oxidation reaction by conducting electron capture experiments. illustrates a significant increase in the rate of O2 production, indicating that the photogenerated holes on the CS-2 surface facilitate the oxidation of OHE^{\u2212} ions into O2 molecules. The UV\u2013vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) technique was employed to evaluate the optical characteristics of the CS catalyst. For , the absorption band of pure SnS2 and CdS samples are observed at approximately 700 nm and 530 nm, respectively, while the CS composites fall within this wavelength range. Therefore, the respective band gap values for SnS2 and CdS can be identified as 2.09 eV and 2.35 eV , respectively. In addition, based on the Mott-Schottky plots  , we determined that SnS2 and CdS have conduction band potentials of \u22120.66 V and \u22120.61 V (vs NHE), respectively. Therefore, the valence band potentials of SnS2 and CdS can be determined as 1.43 and 1.74 V, respectively. Gratifyingly, the band structures of CdS and SnS2 meet the requirements for NO3 E^{\u2212} reduction and water decomposition to generate oxygen. The utilization of the piezoelectric response force microscope (PFM) aims to enhance the understanding of the piezoelectric characteristics of CS samples. For a\u2013c and , the morphology of CS-2 displayed a rod-like structure with directional flake formations, which is in harmony with the relative amplitude images and phase transition signal images, suggesting the excellent local piezoelectric response. Interestingly, the CS-2 material exhibits a dispersion of phase inversion and charge distribution on its outer layer, while other factors are concentrated within the material. This observation suggests that the leaves of CS-2 experience maximum stress, leading to significant deformation of constituent atoms. All the prepared catalysts exhibited both the characteristic hysteresis loops of phase-voltage (\u223c180\xb0) and butterfly-shaped curves of amplitude-voltage (d and ), providing evidence for the inherent piezoelectric properties. As a result, it was determined that CS-2 exhibited a significantly higher piezoelectric coefficient (d33) of 3.11 p.m./V (e), which is approximately 1.39 times greater than that of RCS (2.24 p.m./V). To further confirm the disparity in piezoelectric potential between CS-2 and RCS, we utilized COMSOL Multiphysics software to simulate the pressure distribution. On the contrary, the leaves of CS-2 experience maximum stress ( f), which is harmony with the PFM results, resulting in a high proportion of constituent atoms being deformed. This leads to a significant increase in surface polarizability , which is confirmed by the Polarization\u2013electric field (P\u2013E) hysteresis loops. On the other hand, the presence of significant residual stress on the surface of SnS2 results in an expansion of the surface lattice spacing and an increase in structural disorder. As shown in , the average lifetime (\u03c4) of charges for CS-2 is 0.77 ns, which is significantly longer than that of RCS (0.60 ns), SnS2 (0.45 ns), and CdS (0.26 ns). As shown in , CS-2 exhibits a significant improvement in photocurrent density compared to pure CdS, SnS2, and RCS, indicating an enhanced efficiency in charge carrier separation due to its macroscopic polarization at the surface. Additionally, EIS analysis and steady-state fluorescence were performed on the prepared samples. shows that the arc radius of CS-2 is comparatively smaller under different condition, which aligns with the PL results  and indicates an enhanced efficiency in charge carrier separation for the stress acting on the surface. In order to further confirm the underlying charge transfer, in situ XPS has been conducted. illustrates that the electron density of the Cd 3d and Sn 3d spectra in CS-2 shifts towards higher and lower energies upon exposure to light, respectively. This provides direct evidence of charge carrier migration from CdS to SnS2. Besides, the work function values for the pure CdS and SnS2 were approximately 5.71 eV and 5.88 eV , respectively, further suggesting that the photo-induced electrons in CdS can spontaneously migrate towards SnS2 at the heterojunction interface in order to establish equilibrium in the Fermi level. Therefore, charge rearrangement between phases in a heterojunction creates a potential difference, leading to the formation of a built-in electric field (BIEF). In addition, the BIEF of CS-2 was measured in both dark and light conditions using KPFM. In g\u2013h and (SI), the surface potential of CS-2 decreases from 125.8 mV to 104.5 mV after exposure to light, while the RCS decreases from 61.5 mV to 52.3 mV. These results can be attributed to the existence of an intrinsic electric field and dipoles generated by charge transfer within CS-2, which lead to a partial reduction in piezo-induced polarization charge due to photo-generated carriers. It is evident that there is an electron transfer from CdS to SnS2 at the heterojunction interface, resulting in an accumulation of holes on CdS. In contrast to RCS, CS-2 displays a more concentrated center of charge, which can be attributed to the stress structure associated with the surface, enhancing material polarization and thereby intensifies charge separation even further. Above all, the presence of significant residual stress on the surface of SnS2 leads to a dispersion of local stress concentrations, resulting in deformation of a substantial number of constituent atoms. To enhance our comprehension of the reaction mechanism, we employed in situ FTIR spectroscopy to examine the reduction process of NO3 E^{\u2212}. In a, the broad peaks around 3000\u20133700 cmE^{\u22121} are associated with the adsorption of \u2217N/\u2217NH/\u2217NH2/\u2217NH3. Besides, the presence of intermediate products \u2217NO, \u2217NO2, \u2217NH, and NH2 was detected at 1560, 1340, 1260, and 1150 cmE^{\u22121}. Importantly, the raw materials and products of NO3 E^{\u2212} and NH4 E^{+} exhibited peaks at 1405 and 1450 cmE^{\u22121}, respectively. Notably, the increased characteristic peak at 1640 cmE^{\u22121} is attributed to the bending vibration of the adsorbed H2O , indicating that residual stress on the surface of SnS2 enhances the exposure of surface microenvironment for H absorption. Based on the findings and relevant literature, we propose a gradual transformation of CS-2 into NH3 through a series of adsorption steps: \u2217NO3 \u2192 \u2217NO2OH \u2192 \u2217NO2 \u2192 \u2217NOOH \u2192 \u2217NO \u2192 \u2217NOH \u2192 \u2217N \u2192 \u2217NH \u2192 \u2217NH2 \u2192 \u2217NH3. Our findings suggest that exposure to light or ultrasound leads to a shift towards higher wavenumbers in the Sn\u2013S bonds of CS-2, indicating the release of residual stress on the surface of SnS2 and resulting in dynamic reconstruction. Shortening the Sn\u2013S bond length not only augments local electron density but also enhances adsorption molecule-surface interaction, leading to more stable adsorption. To explore the mechanism of adsorption activation, we employed a contact angle to monitor the initial stages of the PPNR primary reaction process. illustrate that CS-2 displays a reduced contact angle in both aqueous and nitrate solutions, indicating that the surface of SnS2 experiences lower residual stress, thereby creating an optimal microenvironment for the interaction between surface hydrogen and reactants. To investigate the impact of \u2217H on the PPNR process, a \u2217H quenching experiment was conducted by introducing tertiary butanol (TBA). As depicted in b, CS-2 exhibited a significant reduction in the rate of NH3 production, suggesting the CS-2 provided a large number of active hydrogen sites. To further confirm the H adsorption capacity, DFT calculations has been carried out. As shown in c, the Gibbs free energy values for \u2217H over CS-2, RCS, SnS2, and CdS, are observed to be \u22121.03 eV, \u22120.91 eV, \u22120.87 eV, and \u22120.23 eV, respectively, indicating that the presence of a loose structure promotes favorable adsorption of \u2217H. As we know, the adsorption of NO3 E^{\u2212} on the catalyst surface is considered to be the initial deoxidation step determines the rate of reaction. To determine the initial activation state of nitric acid, DFT calculations have been conducted. As depicted in d, the Gibbs free energy linked to \u2217NO3 within CS-2, RCS, SnS2, and CdS exhibits values of \u22122.38, \u22121.58, \u22121.53, and \u22121.12 eV, implying that residual stress present on the surface of SnS2 enhances the availability of active sites for NO3 E^{\u2212} adsorption. Furthermore, the application of external pressure can further decrease the activation energy of the reaction, indicating that under external stress, the surface of SnS2 will experience enhanced reconstruction and expose more active sites. Significantly, the charge discrepancies observed at the adsorption sites of O and N in CS-2, RCS, CdS, and SnS2 were found to be \u22120.56 |e|, \u22120.25 |e|, \u22120.20 |e|, and \u22120.12 |e|, respectively (e and , SI). The presence of residual stress on the surface of SnS2 leads to changes in lattice spacing and an increase in structural disorder, resulting in polarization and uneven charge distribution at the active site. Under stress, the charge differences on the CS-2 and RCS increased to \u22120.58 |e| and \u22120.29 |e| (f and , SI), respectively. This suggests that the external stress induced structural changes, leading to enhanced electronic coupling for the NO3 E^{\u2212} adsorption and activation. As shown in d and S35\u201338 (SI), the reduction of Gibbs free energy for hydrogenation of \u2217NO3 to \u2217NO2OH is observed in CS-2, RCS, CdS, and SnS2 is reduced to the \u22121.65, 1.31, \u22120.95, and \u22121.22 eV, respectively, indicating the challenging nature of NO3 E^{\u2212} surface hydrogenation. However, in CS-2, this step of \u2217NO2 \u2192 \u2217NO2H and \u2217NO \u2192 \u2217NOH to be facile, indicating the need to optimize intermediate adsorption and simultaneously generate a substantial supply of H\u2217 for efficient deep deoxygenation of N-containing intermediates, thus helping impede the production of nitrogen oxides. Notably, the hydrogenation steps from \u2217N \u2192 \u2217NH \u2192 \u2217NH2 exhibit an endothermic process in terms of Gibbs free energy. Moreover, external influences can effectively reduce the adsorption energy of the intermediate by inducing dynamic reconstruction of the SnS2 surface under external stress.

# INTRODUCTION
Ammonia (NH3) is of utmost importance as a fundamental raw material in the manufacturing processes of diverse chemicals, including fertilizers, synthetic fibers, and pharmaceuticals. Currently, the industrial production of NH3 heavily relies on the energy-intensive Haber-Bosch process, resulting in a detrimental impact on the environment. Recently, the photocatalytic reduction of nitrate (NO3 E^{\u2212}) has garnered significant attention due to its low bond dissociation energy and the remarkable solubility of NO3 E^{\u2212}. Moreover, the increasing presence of NO3 E^{\u2212} in water sources has resulted in disruptions to the ecological system and poses potential risks to both public health and environmental stability. Therefore, the simultaneous attainment of environmental and energy objectives can be achieved by employing photocatalytic nitrate reduction to produce valuable NH3. Therefore, the integration of piezocatalysis and photocatalysis (PPNR) is expected to result in a significant advancement in the conversion of nitrates into valuable NH3. Notably, wurtzite CdS with a unique noncentro-symmetric structure has garnered considerable interest in the fields of piezo-photocatalysis and NO3 E^{\u2212} reduction. For example, SnS2, known for its large specific surface area, high strain response, and abundant active sites, holds great promise as a potential candidate for constructing heterojunctions to enhance piezo-photocatalytic activity. In this study, we have successfully prepared a precise and adjustable surface macroscopic polarization by incorporating SnS2 nanoplates onto 1D CdS nanorods (CS) through a two-step hydrothermal process. Experimental results demonstrate that the presence of significant residual stress on the surface of SnS2 leads to the dispersion of local stress concentrations, which results in the deformation of a substantial number of surface constituent atoms, leading to an increase in both surface structural disorder and macroscopic polarization. Additionally, the macroscopic polarization of the surface structure induces dynamic reconstruction to expose numerous active sites, creating an advantageous microenvironment for the interaction between surface H and NO3 E^{\u2212} ions, which facilitates electron accumulation and promotes polarity interactions as well as regulates the adsorption energy of intermediates. Impressively, the optimized CS-2 exhibited an excellent NH4 E^{+} production rate of 7.99 mmol gE^{\u22121} hE^{\u22121} without using a sacrificial agent or cocatalyst, which is 114 times greater than that of CdS.

# CONCLUSION
In summary, a novel method has been meticulously constructed to enhance the overall surface macroscopic polarization by incorporating SnS2 nanoplates onto 1D CdS nanorods, resulting in the formation of a uniformly distributed surface tensile strain in the traditional piezoelectric heterojunction. DFT results and experimental findings suggest that these structural configurations lead to an increase in structural disorder and dynamic reconfiguration, which exacerbates overall polarization and uneven charge distribution, facilitating efficient charge transfer. Moreover, the synergistic combination of surface strain structure and piezoelectric effect induces dynamic reconstruction, creating an optimal microenvironment for the interaction between surface hydrogen (H) and nitrate (NO3 E^{\u2212}) ions. Fortunately, the optimized CS-2 exhibited an excellent NH4 E^{+} production rate of 7.99 mmol gE^{\u22121} hE^{\u22121} without using a sacrificial agent or cocatalyst, which is 114 times greater than that of CdS.
