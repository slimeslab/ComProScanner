# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
shows the half-normal probability plot obtained from the influence of KIV (i.e., magnetron power, Ar gas flow, and N2 gas flow) and the interaction between them, on the deposition rate (referred in DoE as key output variable, KOV) of the AlN thin films obtained from the profilometry measurements (see ). This plot compares the absolute value of the effect from each KIV (circles in ) and their interactions (squares in ), on the probability scale (see Section B of for further discussion about the half normal plot). For a given factor, the absolute effect is the difference of the average response variable over high factor levels X\u0305(+) minus the average response over the low factor levels X\u0305(\u2212). The absolute effect is calculated by Where X\u0305(+) and X\u0305(\u2212) are high and low factor levels, respectively. If the points are above the line will often indicate a positive effect, which means higher values of the corresponding KIV will contribute positive to KOVs. Here, the DoE demonstrates that both magnetron power and Ar flow are the KIV that most affect the growth rate of the AlN, as are the points that deviate from the line-orange line in. Moreover, power is the only parameter above the alpha level in the half normal scores (0.05). Moreover, AlN tensile stress and stoichiometry is influenced by the deposition rate. (a-g) shows the SEM-EDX spectrum obtained at the surface of samples. For samples #S1, #S2 and #S3, the main peaks correspond to Al and N atoms. On the other hand, samples S4-S8 have a higher intensity of the oxygen peak. (h) shows the N/Al ratio (left axis), obtained through the atomic percentage of nitrogen (N) divided by the atomic percentage of aluminum (Al), and the atomic percentage of oxygen (O) on the right axis. In this regard, samples S1 (4.98 nm/min), S2 (8.70 nm/min) and S3 (5.28 nm/min) exhibit N/Al ratio of around 1, which corresponds to highly stoichiometric crystals (see green dashed line in (h)). On the other hand, samples S4 (2.34 nm/min), S6 (1.02 nm/min) and S8 (0.84 nm/min) show a higher percentage of oxygen in the film structure leading to a stoichiometry highly differing from the ideal 1:1. Sample S7 shows a N:Al stoichiometry closer to 1:1, however the presence of oxygen is quite high, around 25 %. Samples deposited at lower powers have more porosity as a consequence of lower energy of ions and a lower density of ions, which enhance the post-oxidation effects in porous layers. shows the XRD spectra of samples. Samples S1, S2 and S3 are the only ones among all samples exhibiting diffraction peaks corresponding to a crystalline phase of AlN. Diffractograms S4-S8 do not show any diffraction peak. Regarding S1, S2 and S3, the major diffraction peak is observed around 2\u03b8 = 36.06\xb0 corresponds to (002) plane, characteristic of the wurtzite structure of AlN (extracted from Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD) n\xba 54697 ). Sample S1 shows (002) peak centered at that 2\u03b8 = 36.00\xb0, whereas both #S2 and #S3 present (002) diffraction peak located at slightly lower angle (35.98\xb0), indicating an increase of the tensile stress on the film. Furthermore, (002) peak is wider in #S2 and #S3 than in #S1, which means a smaller crystallite size in #S2 and #S3. The FWHM of (002) peak shows low values on these samples, being 0.28, 0.43 and 0.32 for S1, S2 and S3 respectively. In a first order approximation, a reduction of the FWHM indicates larger grain size. Although samples have different thickness, a relative comparison of the FWHM indicates that sample S1 is the one showing bigger grains as it has a higher FWHM than S2 and S3. In terms of relative intensities, S1, S2 and S3 samples present 100 % for (002) orientation. Moreover, minimal diffraction signals are detected, mainly in samples #S2 and #S3, corresponding to AlN (100), at 2\u03b8 = 33.204\xb0and to AlN (101) at 2\u03b8 = 37.734\xb0. Sample S2 shows a relative intensity of 17 % for (100) and 7 % for (101), while S3 shows 50 % for (100) and 31 % for (101). These relative intensities deviate from the reference values that are 100 % for (100), 65 % for (002) and 86 % for (101). Additionally, samples #S2 and #S3 have shoulders in the (002) peak, which can be a consequence of crystal strain or heterogeneous grain size in the layer. Consequently, XRD confirms the crystallinity of these 3 samples. To sum up, samples #S1, #S2 and #S3, which are the samples that have more nitrogen incorporated and were deposited at higher deposition speeds, show the peak corresponding to the c-axis, (002) direction. This direction is where the polarization vector is stronger and it is related to the d 33 piezoelectric coefficient, which is the largest among all the d ij. shows TEM micrographs in BF mode of the sputtered AlN thin films with high stoichiometry and low oxygen content, i.e., those deposited under of #S1, #S2 and #S3 conditions (see ). Specifically, (a-c) present HRTEM micrographs of the AlN films and (d-f) their corresponding fast-Fourier transform (FFT). (a-c) show Moir\xe9 fringes, resulting from the interference of two sets of planes. By measuring in the FFT pattern the distance between the main spots and its symmetrical, the interplanar distance is calculated. From these measurements, the deduced interplanar distances are 0.27, 0.25 and 0.24 nm which corresponds to the (100), (002) and (101) families, respectively. Moreover, it is possible to do an approach of the grain size by comparing the FFT patterns. (d) shows a ring pattern with more defined spots than (e) and (f), where the patterns are well defined Debye-Scherrer rings. This indicates that #S1 presents wider grains than #S2 and #S3. This result is in agreement with those obtained in XRD, where S1 was the sample with lower FWHM, which indicates a bigger grain size. h shows the FFT of the grains of g. In this area, a pattern corresponding to the [010] pole is identified (i). Therefore, the TEM lamella is parallel to the (010) planes of a family of grains. These grains have their c-axis (direction [001]) perpendicular to the AlN/Si interface. Specifically, the presence of (002) orientation is crucial, as this orientation is the main responsible of the piezoelectric properties of the film. shows Selected Area Electron Diffraction (SAED), DF-TEM micrographs of samples (a) #S1, (#b) #S2 and (c) #S3 recorded using the [002], [100] and [101] reflections. SAED technique selects just a certain area of the sample by inserting an aperture (10 \xb5m) above the specimen. The main observed rings correspond to the family of plains (002), (100) and (101). The blue circumference marks the position of the objective aperture used for the DF micrograph. In these cases, the objective aperture is centered in the (002) spot. However, the smallest objective aperture available (10 \xb5m) is too big to select just the contribution of a single spot from the diffraction pattern, so the selected point covers the contributions of spots belonging to three different rings: (002), (100) and (101). Most of the grains that are illuminated have (002) orientation as the aperture is centered in that spot. Additionally, sample #S3 shows slightly tilted grains, 15\xba respect the c-axis, measured by ImageJ software. This is explained in terms of the different deposition conditions compared to samples #S1 and #S2. #S3 has been deposited at a higher pressure (4.15\xb710E^{\u22123} mbar) than #S1 and #S2 (3.4\xb710E^{\u22123} and 3.33\xb710E^{\u22123} mbar, respectively), as its total gas flow is 80 sccm, compared to the 60 sccm of total gas flow of #S1 and #S2. These phenomena will enhance the growth of (100) direction, instead of the c-axis direction (002), as the Al-N bond in the direction of the c-axis is higher. These results agree with XRD results, as the diffractogram #S3 shows a diffraction peak at 2\u03b8= 33.204, that corresponds to (100) orientation. (a) is a HRTEM micrograph of sample #S1 in cross-sectional view, showing the AlN/Si interface. Three sections are distinguished in this micrograph: AlN polycrystalline phase on the top (Zoom 1), an amorphous phase as interlayer (Zoom 2), and Si (100) substrate (Zoom 3). Each zoom has its corresponding FFT, comprising Zoom1-FFT1, Zoom2-FFT2, and Zoom 3-FFT3 presented in (e,d,f), respectively. FFT2-which is the FFT of the Zoom 2- shows less spots than FFT1 and contributions of an amorphous phase, as it shows amorphous circles, different from the polycrystalline rings observed in FFT1. On the other hand, regarding the grain size, Cutout 1, and Cutout 2 of show areas, pointed out with a dashed circumference, where grains of the indicated size are revealed. The deposited film has been divided in two sections for this purpose (Cutout 1 in (b), and Cutout 2 in (c)) as there is a clear difference between the grain size of the very first nanometers (\u223c10nm) of the deposited film and the grain size of the rest of it. The section of Cutout 1 shows larger grains (> 5 nm) than the grains observed in Cutout 2 (<5 nm). These results agree with those of FFT, as FFT1 shows more distinguished spots than FFT2, which indicates a larger grain size. Additionally, EDX through STEM has been carried out to study the elemental composition along the layer of sample #S1 ((g) STEM micrograph using HAADF detector). The section corresponding to Zoom2 in (e) shows a composition of a higher concentration of oxygen than nitrogen, being the opposite composition of Zoom1 ((d)), that presents a higher concentration of nitrogen than oxygen. This HRTEM micrograph indicates that the interlayer of sample #S1 observed in (c) (Cutout 2) corresponds to small grains of AlN (<5 nm) in a matrix of an amorphous phase of AlxNyOz. The native oxygen on Si (100) along with the residual oxygen in the reaction chamber and the low deposition temperature have produced this interlayer, as is reported by Hwang et al.. (a) presents d 33 coefficient measured in AlN thin films with different stoichiometries, i.e., N/Al ratios (see EDX analysis above). From that study, one could easily understand that samples with a better stoichiometry, i.e., samples with a N/Al ratio closer to 1 (S1, S2 and S3), are those AlN thin films exhibiting a higher d 33 coefficient of around 4.5\u20135 pC/N. These results are in good agreement with those of the XRD and TEM, as the samples that present a higher d 33 coefficient match with the ones that show good (002) orientation. A c-axis (002) orientation of the hexagonal AlN is necessary for enhance the d 33 coefficient of the material. Furthermore, as reported by Fei et al., the piezoelectric stress constant is significantly influenced by the c-axis and the (002) orientation distribution. Additionally, the slightly titling angle observed in sample S3 ((c)) may have reduced the d 33 coefficient, i.e., the effective d 33 is reduced by a factor cos \u03b3, where \u03b3 is the angle of the c-axis with respect to the substrate normal (see (c)). The mixture of grains and their size observed in HRTEM micrographs might contribute to reduce the d 33 due to the inversion of domains as it creates dipoles in opposite directions. The DoE demonstrates that magnetron power combined with the nitrogen flow is the factor interaction that affects the most the d 33 of the film, as is the factor interaction with a higher absolute effect and deviates more above the line within the power. However, these points do not affect significantly to the d 33 as they do not deviate drastically from the line.

# ABSTRACT
Aluminum nitride (AlN) is a wide band gap semiconductor with interesting piezoelectric properties for many applications, including micromechanical systems (MEMS), acoustic wave sensors or energy harvesting devices. The influence of DC reactive magnetron sputtering (DCRMS) deposition parameters on the structural, crystalline, and piezoelectric properties of AlN thin films are presented. AlN films have been deposited with a high crystal quality, showing low values of FWHM (0.28) and c-axis orientation parallel oriented respect to the growth direction, as evidenced by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). These samples also showed a high piezoelectric coefficient (d
                     33) of 5 pC/N for AlN thin films.

# INTRODUCTION
Aluminum nitride (AlN) is a wide bandgap (6.2 eV ) semiconductor compound with outstanding properties for many applications. This metal nitride is an excellent candidate for the fabrication of electronic devices thanks to its high thermal conductivity of 200 W mE^{\u22121} KE^{1} combined with its superior insulating properties (range of \u03c1 = 10E^{9}\u201310E^{11}\u03a9m). As a consequence of reducing the thickness (t <10 \xb5m), these devices are able to operate at high frequencies , opening opportunities for AlN thin film devices to contribute in the area of MHz or even GHz. Furthermore, the non-centrosymmetric character of AlN wurtzite structure (i.e., the crystal structure lacks inversion symmetry), exhibiting a strong piezoelectric coefficient along its c-axis (d 33) ranging from 3.4 to 5.2 pC/N for the case of polycrystalline films , makes it a very interesting material for a number of applications. For example, AlN function as an active layer in a variety of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) based sensors and actuators. AlN has been also deposited on diamond for high-frequency surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices , taking advantage of electromechanical coupling properties, making AlN to improve the acoustic impedance between both materials. AlN has also demonstrated great potential in SAW devices for microfluidic applications, which is required in areas such as biochemical sensing or drug development. For instance, a MEMS-based vibration energy harvester with AlN piezoelectric thin film has an output power density of 854.55 \xb5W/(cmE^{3}\xb7gE^{2}). In this regard, optimization of AlN film microstructure is crucial in order to achieve high quality piezoelectric properties, where d 33 coefficient is enhanced as the (002) orientation in the wurtzite hexagonal structure of the AlN crystal is maximized. However, the d 33 coefficient has not been analyzed as a function of other AlN properties studied in this work, such as grain size and orientation, and chemical composition and stoichiometry, where pure AlN preventing oxygen incorporation inside the crystal lattice is desirable to achieve maximum d 33. Achieving AlN thin films with a crystal structure well-oriented along c-axis, i.e., <0001> direction in wurtzite nomenclature, is still very challenging due to the unintentional incorporation of oxygen inside the AlN structure observed in standard physical vapor deposition (PVD) procedures. That oxygen contamination as well as other microstructural factors such as grain size reduction/increase, and lattice strain have been demonstrated to reduce the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of (002) peak in AlN. To overcome this challenge, a thorough investigation of the AlN growth kinetics has been carried out using various techniques, including reactive direct current (DC) , reactive pulsed DC , reactive radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering, metal-organic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD) , and molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Sputtering, is a PVD method capable to produce high crystal quality thin films at moderately low substrate temperatures (< 100\u2103 ) which is an advantage in comparison to its counterparts CVD (> 500\u2103) , and MBE (700\u2103 to 1000\u2103). That feature makes PVD depositions be compatible with non-conventional substrates for flexible/stretchable electronics and energy systems. Among the sputtering techniques, DC reactive sputtering presents higher deposition rates (30 nm/min) , producing microns depositions in a relatively short time, preserving the quality. This is useful for ultrasonic applications, where 10\u201320 \xb5m is needed for transducers. Regarding the gas flow for example, it can affect the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of XRD peaks of the deposited AlN films. For instance, some studies mention that by increasing the nitrogen flow ratio, the intensity of the (002) peak increases and the FWHM of the peak decreases. Other works defend that a (002) preferred orientation can be achieved by deposition processes with a higher concentration of argon than nitrogen. While some studies report a better crystalline quality of AlN layers by increasing the power , other publications propose that a reduction in the power results in a enhancement of the (002) orientation. shows a comparison of the FWHM (XRD) of the (002) orientation of AlN films deposited under different conditions of power and Ar and nitrogen flow. The last row corresponds to the data obtained in this work for the FWHM obtained for the (002) XRD diffraction peak for sample #S1. In this work, a series of depositions have been carried out by DC reactive magnetron sputtering method using DoE to plan the deposition conditions (magnetron power, N2 flow and Ar flow) of AlN thin films.

# CONCLUSION
This work highlights the benefits of using DoE for the optimization of DC reactive magnetron sputtering deposition conditions to obtain piezoelectric AlN thin films. The deposition rate has been taken into account as KOV as it influences the film properties in terms of impurity incorporation and tensile stress. This work demonstrates that AlN thin films with high-crystal quality and c-axis (002) well-oriented with growth direction is achieved by using a power of 400 W, 20 sccm of Ar flow and 40 sccm of N2 flow. It is stablished that increase of N2 flow produce films with better crystallinity (lower FWHM) and increase of Ar flow also enhance the (100) orientation. SEM-EDX analysis indicated that higher nitrogen incorporation is obtained at a higher power (400 W). XRD and TEM analysis have confirmed the crystalline nature of samples #S1 (400 W, 20:40 Ar:N2), #S2 (400 W, 40:20 Ar:N2) and #S3 (400 W, 40:40 Ar:N2), which show a well oriented c-axis orientation (002), i.e. aligned with the crystal growth direction. However, sample S3 conditions produce tilting, which slightly reduce the effective d 33 as gamma angle is off-tilt. Moreover, the analysis of the interface shows that the first 15 nm of the layers have amorphous regions and smaller grains (<5 nm), in contrast with the rest of the film, which shows bigger and columnar grains. The d 33 coefficient measurements have revealed that samples with better stoichiometry, lower oxygen incorporation and well oriented c-axis exhibit higher piezoelectric coefficients (4.5\u20135 pC/N), that confirms the connection between crystallinity and piezoelectricity.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
shows the half-normal probability plot obtained from the influence of KIV (i.e., magnetron power, Ar gas flow, and N2 gas flow) and the interaction between them, on the deposition rate (referred in DoE as key output variable, KOV) of the AlN thin films obtained from the profilometry measurements (see ). This plot compares the absolute value of the effect from each KIV (circles in ) and their interactions (squares in ), on the probability scale (see Section B of for further discussion about the half normal plot). For a given factor, the absolute effect is the difference of the average response variable over high factor levels X\u0305(+) minus the average response over the low factor levels X\u0305(\u2212). The absolute effect is calculated by Where X\u0305(+) and X\u0305(\u2212) are high and low factor levels, respectively. If the points are above the line will often indicate a positive effect, which means higher values of the corresponding KIV will contribute positive to KOVs. Here, the DoE demonstrates that both magnetron power and Ar flow are the KIV that most affect the growth rate of the AlN, as are the points that deviate from the line-orange line in. Moreover, power is the only parameter above the alpha level in the half normal scores (0.05). Moreover, AlN tensile stress and stoichiometry is influenced by the deposition rate. (a-g) shows the SEM-EDX spectrum obtained at the surface of samples. For samples #S1, #S2 and #S3, the main peaks correspond to Al and N atoms. On the other hand, samples S4-S8 have a higher intensity of the oxygen peak. (h) shows the N/Al ratio (left axis), obtained through the atomic percentage of nitrogen (N) divided by the atomic percentage of aluminum (Al), and the atomic percentage of oxygen (O) on the right axis. In this regard, samples S1 (4.98 nm/min), S2 (8.70 nm/min) and S3 (5.28 nm/min) exhibit N/Al ratio of around 1, which corresponds to highly stoichiometric crystals (see green dashed line in (h)). On the other hand, samples S4 (2.34 nm/min), S6 (1.02 nm/min) and S8 (0.84 nm/min) show a higher percentage of oxygen in the film structure leading to a stoichiometry highly differing from the ideal 1:1. Sample S7 shows a N:Al stoichiometry closer to 1:1, however the presence of oxygen is quite high, around 25 %. Samples deposited at lower powers have more porosity as a consequence of lower energy of ions and a lower density of ions, which enhance the post-oxidation effects in porous layers. shows the XRD spectra of samples. Samples S1, S2 and S3 are the only ones among all samples exhibiting diffraction peaks corresponding to a crystalline phase of AlN. Diffractograms S4-S8 do not show any diffraction peak. Regarding S1, S2 and S3, the major diffraction peak is observed around 2\u03b8 = 36.06\xb0 corresponds to (002) plane, characteristic of the wurtzite structure of AlN (extracted from Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD) n\xba 54697 ). Sample S1 shows (002) peak centered at that 2\u03b8 = 36.00\xb0, whereas both #S2 and #S3 present (002) diffraction peak located at slightly lower angle (35.98\xb0), indicating an increase of the tensile stress on the film. Furthermore, (002) peak is wider in #S2 and #S3 than in #S1, which means a smaller crystallite size in #S2 and #S3. The FWHM of (002) peak shows low values on these samples, being 0.28, 0.43 and 0.32 for S1, S2 and S3 respectively. In a first order approximation, a reduction of the FWHM indicates larger grain size. Although samples have different thickness, a relative comparison of the FWHM indicates that sample S1 is the one showing bigger grains as it has a higher FWHM than S2 and S3. In terms of relative intensities, S1, S2 and S3 samples present 100 % for (002) orientation. Moreover, minimal diffraction signals are detected, mainly in samples #S2 and #S3, corresponding to AlN (100), at 2\u03b8 = 33.204\xb0and to AlN (101) at 2\u03b8 = 37.734\xb0. Sample S2 shows a relative intensity of 17 % for (100) and 7 % for (101), while S3 shows 50 % for (100) and 31 % for (101). These relative intensities deviate from the reference values that are 100 % for (100), 65 % for (002) and 86 % for (101). Additionally, samples #S2 and #S3 have shoulders in the (002) peak, which can be a consequence of crystal strain or heterogeneous grain size in the layer. Consequently, XRD confirms the crystallinity of these 3 samples. To sum up, samples #S1, #S2 and #S3, which are the samples that have more nitrogen incorporated and were deposited at higher deposition speeds, show the peak corresponding to the c-axis, (002) direction. This direction is where the polarization vector is stronger and it is related to the d 33 piezoelectric coefficient, which is the largest among all the d ij. shows TEM micrographs in BF mode of the sputtered AlN thin films with high stoichiometry and low oxygen content, i.e., those deposited under of #S1, #S2 and #S3 conditions (see ). Specifically, (a-c) present HRTEM micrographs of the AlN films and (d-f) their corresponding fast-Fourier transform (FFT). (a-c) show Moir\xe9 fringes, resulting from the interference of two sets of planes. By measuring in the FFT pattern the distance between the main spots and its symmetrical, the interplanar distance is calculated. From these measurements, the deduced interplanar distances are 0.27, 0.25 and 0.24 nm which corresponds to the (100), (002) and (101) families, respectively. Moreover, it is possible to do an approach of the grain size by comparing the FFT patterns. (d) shows a ring pattern with more defined spots than (e) and (f), where the patterns are well defined Debye-Scherrer rings. This indicates that #S1 presents wider grains than #S2 and #S3. This result is in agreement with those obtained in XRD, where S1 was the sample with lower FWHM, which indicates a bigger grain size. h shows the FFT of the grains of g. In this area, a pattern corresponding to the [010] pole is identified (i). Therefore, the TEM lamella is parallel to the (010) planes of a family of grains. These grains have their c-axis (direction [001]) perpendicular to the AlN/Si interface. Specifically, the presence of (002) orientation is crucial, as this orientation is the main responsible of the piezoelectric properties of the film. shows Selected Area Electron Diffraction (SAED), DF-TEM micrographs of samples (a) #S1, (#b) #S2 and (c) #S3 recorded using the [002], [100] and [101] reflections. SAED technique selects just a certain area of the sample by inserting an aperture (10 \xb5m) above the specimen. The main observed rings correspond to the family of plains (002), (100) and (101). The blue circumference marks the position of the objective aperture used for the DF micrograph. In these cases, the objective aperture is centered in the (002) spot. However, the smallest objective aperture available (10 \xb5m) is too big to select just the contribution of a single spot from the diffraction pattern, so the selected point covers the contributions of spots belonging to three different rings: (002), (100) and (101). Most of the grains that are illuminated have (002) orientation as the aperture is centered in that spot. Additionally, sample #S3 shows slightly tilted grains, 15\xba respect the c-axis, measured by ImageJ software. This is explained in terms of the different deposition conditions compared to samples #S1 and #S2. #S3 has been deposited at a higher pressure (4.15\xb710E^{\u22123} mbar) than #S1 and #S2 (3.4\xb710E^{\u22123} and 3.33\xb710E^{\u22123} mbar, respectively), as its total gas flow is 80 sccm, compared to the 60 sccm of total gas flow of #S1 and #S2. These phenomena will enhance the growth of (100) direction, instead of the c-axis direction (002), as the Al-N bond in the direction of the c-axis is higher. These results agree with XRD results, as the diffractogram #S3 shows a diffraction peak at 2\u03b8= 33.204, that corresponds to (100) orientation. (a) is a HRTEM micrograph of sample #S1 in cross-sectional view, showing the AlN/Si interface. Three sections are distinguished in this micrograph: AlN polycrystalline phase on the top (Zoom 1), an amorphous phase as interlayer (Zoom 2), and Si (100) substrate (Zoom 3). Each zoom has its corresponding FFT, comprising Zoom1-FFT1, Zoom2-FFT2, and Zoom 3-FFT3 presented in (e,d,f), respectively. FFT2-which is the FFT of the Zoom 2- shows less spots than FFT1 and contributions of an amorphous phase, as it shows amorphous circles, different from the polycrystalline rings observed in FFT1. On the other hand, regarding the grain size, Cutout 1, and Cutout 2 of show areas, pointed out with a dashed circumference, where grains of the indicated size are revealed. The deposited film has been divided in two sections for this purpose (Cutout 1 in (b), and Cutout 2 in (c)) as there is a clear difference between the grain size of the very first nanometers (\u223c10nm) of the deposited film and the grain size of the rest of it. The section of Cutout 1 shows larger grains (> 5 nm) than the grains observed in Cutout 2 (<5 nm). These results agree with those of FFT, as FFT1 shows more distinguished spots than FFT2, which indicates a larger grain size. Additionally, EDX through STEM has been carried out to study the elemental composition along the layer of sample #S1 ((g) STEM micrograph using HAADF detector). The section corresponding to Zoom2 in (e) shows a composition of a higher concentration of oxygen than nitrogen, being the opposite composition of Zoom1 ((d)), that presents a higher concentration of nitrogen than oxygen. This HRTEM micrograph indicates that the interlayer of sample #S1 observed in (c) (Cutout 2) corresponds to small grains of AlN (<5 nm) in a matrix of an amorphous phase of AlxNyOz. The native oxygen on Si (100) along with the residual oxygen in the reaction chamber and the low deposition temperature have produced this interlayer, as is reported by Hwang et al.. (a) presents d 33 coefficient measured in AlN thin films with different stoichiometries, i.e., N/Al ratios (see EDX analysis above). From that study, one could easily understand that samples with a better stoichiometry, i.e., samples with a N/Al ratio closer to 1 (S1, S2 and S3), are those AlN thin films exhibiting a higher d 33 coefficient of around 4.5\u20135 pC/N. These results are in good agreement with those of the XRD and TEM, as the samples that present a higher d 33 coefficient match with the ones that show good (002) orientation. A c-axis (002) orientation of the hexagonal AlN is necessary for enhance the d 33 coefficient of the material. Furthermore, as reported by Fei et al., the piezoelectric stress constant is significantly influenced by the c-axis and the (002) orientation distribution. Additionally, the slightly titling angle observed in sample S3 ((c)) may have reduced the d 33 coefficient, i.e., the effective d 33 is reduced by a factor cos \u03b3, where \u03b3 is the angle of the c-axis with respect to the substrate normal (see (c)). The mixture of grains and their size observed in HRTEM micrographs might contribute to reduce the d 33 due to the inversion of domains as it creates dipoles in opposite directions. The DoE demonstrates that magnetron power combined with the nitrogen flow is the factor interaction that affects the most the d 33 of the film, as is the factor interaction with a higher absolute effect and deviates more above the line within the power. However, these points do not affect significantly to the d 33 as they do not deviate drastically from the line.

# ABSTRACT
Aluminum nitride (AlN) is a wide band gap semiconductor with interesting piezoelectric properties for many applications, including micromechanical systems (MEMS), acoustic wave sensors or energy harvesting devices. The influence of DC reactive magnetron sputtering (DCRMS) deposition parameters on the structural, crystalline, and piezoelectric properties of AlN thin films are presented. AlN films have been deposited with a high crystal quality, showing low values of FWHM (0.28) and c-axis orientation parallel oriented respect to the growth direction, as evidenced by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). These samples also showed a high piezoelectric coefficient (d
                     33) of 5 pC/N for AlN thin films.

# INTRODUCTION
Aluminum nitride (AlN) is a wide bandgap (6.2 eV ) semiconductor compound with outstanding properties for many applications. This metal nitride is an excellent candidate for the fabrication of electronic devices thanks to its high thermal conductivity of 200 W mE^{\u22121} KE^{1} combined with its superior insulating properties (range of \u03c1 = 10E^{9}\u201310E^{11}\u03a9m). As a consequence of reducing the thickness (t <10 \xb5m), these devices are able to operate at high frequencies , opening opportunities for AlN thin film devices to contribute in the area of MHz or even GHz. Furthermore, the non-centrosymmetric character of AlN wurtzite structure (i.e., the crystal structure lacks inversion symmetry), exhibiting a strong piezoelectric coefficient along its c-axis (d 33) ranging from 3.4 to 5.2 pC/N for the case of polycrystalline films , makes it a very interesting material for a number of applications. For example, AlN function as an active layer in a variety of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) based sensors and actuators. AlN has been also deposited on diamond for high-frequency surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices , taking advantage of electromechanical coupling properties, making AlN to improve the acoustic impedance between both materials. AlN has also demonstrated great potential in SAW devices for microfluidic applications, which is required in areas such as biochemical sensing or drug development. For instance, a MEMS-based vibration energy harvester with AlN piezoelectric thin film has an output power density of 854.55 \xb5W/(cmE^{3}\xb7gE^{2}). In this regard, optimization of AlN film microstructure is crucial in order to achieve high quality piezoelectric properties, where d 33 coefficient is enhanced as the (002) orientation in the wurtzite hexagonal structure of the AlN crystal is maximized. However, the d 33 coefficient has not been analyzed as a function of other AlN properties studied in this work, such as grain size and orientation, and chemical composition and stoichiometry, where pure AlN preventing oxygen incorporation inside the crystal lattice is desirable to achieve maximum d 33. Achieving AlN thin films with a crystal structure well-oriented along c-axis, i.e., <0001> direction in wurtzite nomenclature, is still very challenging due to the unintentional incorporation of oxygen inside the AlN structure observed in standard physical vapor deposition (PVD) procedures. That oxygen contamination as well as other microstructural factors such as grain size reduction/increase, and lattice strain have been demonstrated to reduce the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of (002) peak in AlN. To overcome this challenge, a thorough investigation of the AlN growth kinetics has been carried out using various techniques, including reactive direct current (DC) , reactive pulsed DC , reactive radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering, metal-organic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD) , and molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Sputtering, is a PVD method capable to produce high crystal quality thin films at moderately low substrate temperatures (< 100\u2103 ) which is an advantage in comparison to its counterparts CVD (> 500\u2103) , and MBE (700\u2103 to 1000\u2103). That feature makes PVD depositions be compatible with non-conventional substrates for flexible/stretchable electronics and energy systems. Among the sputtering techniques, DC reactive sputtering presents higher deposition rates (30 nm/min) , producing microns depositions in a relatively short time, preserving the quality. This is useful for ultrasonic applications, where 10\u201320 \xb5m is needed for transducers. Regarding the gas flow for example, it can affect the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of XRD peaks of the deposited AlN films. For instance, some studies mention that by increasing the nitrogen flow ratio, the intensity of the (002) peak increases and the FWHM of the peak decreases. Other works defend that a (002) preferred orientation can be achieved by deposition processes with a higher concentration of argon than nitrogen. While some studies report a better crystalline quality of AlN layers by increasing the power , other publications propose that a reduction in the power results in a enhancement of the (002) orientation. shows a comparison of the FWHM (XRD) of the (002) orientation of AlN films deposited under different conditions of power and Ar and nitrogen flow. The last row corresponds to the data obtained in this work for the FWHM obtained for the (002) XRD diffraction peak for sample #S1. In this work, a series of depositions have been carried out by DC reactive magnetron sputtering method using DoE to plan the deposition conditions (magnetron power, N2 flow and Ar flow) of AlN thin films.

# CONCLUSION
This work highlights the benefits of using DoE for the optimization of DC reactive magnetron sputtering deposition conditions to obtain piezoelectric AlN thin films. The deposition rate has been taken into account as KOV as it influences the film properties in terms of impurity incorporation and tensile stress. This work demonstrates that AlN thin films with high-crystal quality and c-axis (002) well-oriented with growth direction is achieved by using a power of 400 W, 20 sccm of Ar flow and 40 sccm of N2 flow. It is stablished that increase of N2 flow produce films with better crystallinity (lower FWHM) and increase of Ar flow also enhance the (100) orientation. SEM-EDX analysis indicated that higher nitrogen incorporation is obtained at a higher power (400 W). XRD and TEM analysis have confirmed the crystalline nature of samples #S1 (400 W, 20:40 Ar:N2), #S2 (400 W, 40:20 Ar:N2) and #S3 (400 W, 40:40 Ar:N2), which show a well oriented c-axis orientation (002), i.e. aligned with the crystal growth direction. However, sample S3 conditions produce tilting, which slightly reduce the effective d 33 as gamma angle is off-tilt. Moreover, the analysis of the interface shows that the first 15 nm of the layers have amorphous regions and smaller grains (<5 nm), in contrast with the rest of the film, which shows bigger and columnar grains. The d 33 coefficient measurements have revealed that samples with better stoichiometry, lower oxygen incorporation and well oriented c-axis exhibit higher piezoelectric coefficients (4.5\u20135 pC/N), that confirms the connection between crystallinity and piezoelectricity.
