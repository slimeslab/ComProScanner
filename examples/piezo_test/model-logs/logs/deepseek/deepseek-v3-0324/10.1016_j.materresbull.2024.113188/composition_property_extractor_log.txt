# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
(a) illustrates the XRD spectra of BTZSH-x (x = 0.00 \u2013 0.08) ceramics and gives the standard cards of rhombic (R) phase (BaTiO3 PDF#85-1790), orthogonal (O) phase (BaTiO3 PDF#81-2200) and tetragonal (T) phase (BaTiO3 PDF#81-2201). All ceramic samples exhibit a typical perovskite phase without obvious impurities existence, suggesting a successful incorporation of the doped elements into the BT lattice. By comparing the local enlarged XRD spectra in (b) with the standard card, it can be seen that the ceramics undergo a phase transition from T-phase to O-phase and then to R-phase as x increases. When x = 0.00, the (200) peak splits into two peaks of (002) and (200), confirming the tetragonal phase of the BT. As x increases to 0.02, the (200) peak splits into (220) and (200), indicating the phase transition from T-phase to O-phase. With further increase of x, the R-phase appears and a coexistence of R-O ferroelectric phases can be observed in BTZSH-0.04 ceramic. As x is further increased to 0.06, the characteristic peak of O-phase disappears and the ceramic exists in the form of R-phase. To further confirm the coexistence of two phases (R-O) in BTZSH-0.04 ceramic, a Rietveld refinement of the corresponding XRD spectrum is carried out using GSAS software and the results are shown in (c). The fitting results exhibit that the proportions of R and O phases for BTZSH-0.04 ceramic are 19.47% and 80.53%, indicating the coexistence of R and O phases which is consistent with the XRD measurements. Twelve optical modes (3F1u+F2u) exist for barium titanate in cubic phase. When transformed into tetragonal phase, F1u and F2u split into (A1+E) and (B1+E) modes with Raman activity, respectively. Owing to the long term electrostatic forces in the lattice, (A1+E) splits further into transverse (TO) and longitudinal (LO) components. (a) shows the Raman spectra of BTZSH-x (x = 0.00 \u2013 0.08) at room temperature. When undoped, the characteristic modes of tetragonal phase are observed, including E(TO1), A1(TO1), A1(TO2), E(TO2), A1(TO3) and A1(LO3)/E(LO) at \u223c118 cmE^{\u22121}, \u223c193 cmE^{\u22121}, \u223c260 cmE^{\u22121}, \u223c306 cmE^{\u22121}, \u223c518 cmE^{\u22121} and \u223c718 cmE^{\u22121}, respectively. Although it is difficult to distinguish the T-phase from the O-phase in Raman spectroscopy, the reinforcement of A1(TO1) peak and the attenuation of A1(TO2) peak are sufficient to certify the occurrence of phase transition from T-phase to O-phase from x = 0.00 to x=0.02. when x \u2265 0.04, the A1(LO) vibrational mode arises at about 143 cmE^{\u22121} along with a vanishment of the A1(TO2) vibrational mode, manifesting the emergence of R phase, as shown in (b). The above-mentioned evidence further demonstrates a two-phase coexistence of R and O phases in BTZSH-0.04 ceramic.. illustrates the microstructure and grain sizes of BTZSH-x ceramics. By observing (a-e), it can be concluded that the BT-based ceramics are all well sintered, forming a dense microstructure and a visible grain boundary with low porosity. The average grain sizes (AG) of the BT-based ceramics calculated using nano measure software as explained in (f) exhibit a slight fluctuation around 25\u03bcm-45\u03bcm, implying that tiny amount of ion doping generates a small effect on the grain growth. (g-h) display that the BT and BTZSH-0.04 ceramic powder possess a similar particle size, meaning that the difference of specific surface area and contact area with solutions is negligible. The elemental distribution of BTZSH-0.04 ceramic is further characterized using EDS elemental mapping. Surface elemental composition and valence of the BTZSH-0.04 sample are characterized by XPS as exhibited in. The peaks with binding energies of 794.55 eV and 779.18 eV in (a) belong to Ba 3d3/2 and Ba 3d5/2, respectively, which correspond to BaE^{2+}. In (b), the characteristic peaks of Ti 2p are at 463.90 eV and 458.12 eV, which are attributed to TiE^{4+}. There are two characteristic peaks of O1s in (c). The O1s peak at 529.44 eV is ascribed to the lattice oxygen in the chalcogenide environment, whereas the O1s peak at 531.25 eV is caused by oxygen vacancies. (d) reveals two characteristic peaks of Zr 3d located at 181.38eV (3d 5/2) and 183.76eV (3d 3/2), which associate with the Zr element within +4 chemical state. The Sn 3d spectrum in (e) exhibits two peaks at 486.18 eV and 494.65 eV, corresponding separately to Sn 2p3/2 and Sn 2p1/2 of SnE^{4+}. Moreover, the HfE^{4+} can be confirmed by the signals of Hf 4f7/2 and Hf 4f5/2 are at 15.28 eV and 17.28 eV in (f), respectively. These results indicate that all elements exist as expected and the Zr, Sn and Hf elements are successfully doped into the B-site of BaTiO3. To further clarify the influence of doping on the phase transition of the BTZSH-x ceramics, the temperature dependences of dielectric permittivity (\u03b5 r) are measured and expressed in. Three dielectric peaks can be detected in BT corresponding to the rhombic-orthogonal phase transition (T R-O), the orthogonal-tetragonal phase transition (T O-T) and the Curie temperature (T C). The BTZSH-0.02 ceramic presents a crystalline phase of O-phase at room temperature. When x = 0.04, the T R-O is close to room temperature and the phase transition from R-phase to O-phase may not be completed thoroughly, rendering the BTZSH-0.04 ceramic a coexistence of two ferroelectric phases (R-O). Nevertheless, the T R-O disappears and only the T R-T and T C are observed at x=0.06. With further increase of x, the BTZSH-0.08 ceramic only possesses single dielectric peak (T C) and presents as R-phase at room temperature. (f) shows the phase diagram of BTZSH-x ceramics according to the corresponding \u03b5 r-T relationship profiles. Evidently, the incorporation of Zr, Sn, Hf induces a phase transition behavior with the increase of x and a two-phase coexistence of R-O is perceived near room temperature in BTZSH-0.04 ceramic, validating the analysis of XRD and Raman tests. illustrates the piezoelectric coefficient (d 33) of BTZSH-x ceramics. For BT with single tetragonal phase, the d 33 is only 100+ pC/N. After ion doping, the d 33 of BT-based ceramics increases significantly and reaches the maximum of 350 pC/N in BTZSH-0.04 ceramic. As everyone knows, the polarization directions of T-phase in <001>, R-phase in <111> and O-phase in <110> are 6, 12 and 8, respectively. The catalytic properties of the BTZSH-x ceramics are appraised by degradation of RhB (10mg/L) under ultrasonic vibration. The initial concentration (C 0) after the adsorption-desorption equilibrium and the instantaneous concentration at reaction time t (C t) are calculated according to the UV absorbance at \u223c554nm at certain intervals and the time-resolution degradation efficiency is identified by (C 0-C t)/C 0. Explicitly, the pristine BT ceramic exerts a poor degradation ability while the concentration of RhB solution expresses a remarkable decrease with the increase of ultrasound time for BTZSH-0.04 ceramic as exhibited. By contrast with the undoped BT ceramic, the doped ones illustrate a distinct promotion of degradation efficiency as displayed in (b), indicating that the variation of phase boundary induced by phase transition after doping strengthens the piezo-catalytic activity. Particularly, the BTZSH-0.04 ceramic achieves the optimal catalytic performance with 97.27% at 60min. The kinetics of the degradation process is consistent with a pseudo-primary reaction and is expressed as ln (C t/C 0) =-kt , where k is a first-order kinetic constant representing the rate of degradation, which can be obtained directly by a linear fitting of -ln(C t/C 0) to t. From (c), it can be seen that the degradation rate of RhB by the doped samples is greater than that of the pure BT. On the other hand, the phase transformation from single-phase in BT to multiphase coexistence (R-O) in BTZSH-0.04 ceramic generates increscent spontaneous polarization directions and decrescent polarization rotation energy. Consequently, the maximum degradation rate of 0.056 minE^{\u22121} is observed in BTZSH-0.04 ceramic, which is 7.4 times than that of BT, as illustrated in (d). With further increase of x to 0.08, the BTZSH-0.08 ceramic is R-phase without the existence of multiphase coexistence region, exposing an explicit deterioration of degradation efficiency. Therefore, the degradation capability of different initial concentrations of RhB and various typical dyes by BTZSH-0.04 ceramic is investigated to evaluate its utilization potentiality. As conveyed in (a-c), the degradation ability of BTZSH-0.04 ceramic is inversely related to the initial concentration of RhB. The degradation efficiency of RhB with different initial concentration of 10 mg/L, 20 mg/L, and 30 mg/L is 97.27%, 71.26%, and 40.33%, respectively. An increase in the initial concentration of dye may exceed the capacity of the active sites, leading to a decrease in the piezoelectric catalytic efficiency. (d\u223cf) demonstrate the catalytic degradation properties of different dyes containing RhB, methylene blue (MB) and methyl orange (MO) with the concentration of 10 mg/L. The degradation efficiency of RhB, MB and MO at 60 min is 97.27%, 39.52% and 62.5%, respectively. The inferior degradation efficiency of MB and MO may be imputed to the distinction of their molecular structures with RhB, where the C=N and N=N double bonds add the degradation difficulty. Hence, the cyclability tests of BTZSH-0.04 powder are performed by five degradation cycles of 10mg/L RhB solution as illustrated in (a-b). Fortunately, the BTZSH-0.04 ceramic displays a fascinating catalytic cyclability of more than 90% after undergoing five cycles. The XRD spectra of BTZSH-0.04 ceramic before and after five cycles demonstrate no obvious change of crystal structure, implying its fine stability as a promising selection for wastewater treatment. In addition, reveals the comparison of piezo-catalytic performance of the BTZSH-0.04 ceramic with other common lead-free piezocatalytic materials. Compared with most other lead-free piezocatalysts, the BTZSH-0.04 ceramic in this work displays an excellent degradation ability of organic dye, which encourages its prospective applications for environmental modification. Reactive substances are critical roles in piezocatalysis and their function can be elucidated through introducing diverse radical scavengers into BTZSH-0.04 ceramic reaction system. Benzoquinone (BQ), isopropanol (IPA) and Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt (EDTA-2Na) are served as scavengers of superoxide radical (\u2027O2 E^{\u2212}), hydroxyl radical (\u2027OH) and holes (hE^{+}), respectively. As shown in (a), the degradation capability is greatly inhibited by the addition of BQ, signifying that \u2027O2 E^{\u2212} is the main dominant active species in the degradation procedure. The impact of \u2027OH also cannot be neglected with a certain suppression capability on degrading RhB while hE^{+} plays a minor role in the degradation experiment. Generally, the energy band structure of semiconductors can impose a significant impact on their electronic motion and their catalytic capability is dependent on the valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) potential. UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy is employed to evaluate the band structure of BT and BTZSH-0.04 ceramics as shown in (a), and the bandgap values are calculated based on the Tauc formula as follows : where \u03b1, h, \u03bd, E g and A are the absorption coefficient, Planck's constant, frequency of the incident light, bandgap, and absorption constant, respectively. In the inset of (a), the E g values can be obtained by extrapolating the linear part of the Tauc plot to the energy axis, and those of BT and BTZSH-0.04 ceramics are 3.01 eV and 3.08 eV, respectively, indicating a slight increase in the band gap value after doping. To further figure out the energy band structure, the valence band XPS spectra of BT and BTZSH-0.04 ceramics are measured as implied in (b-c). The valence band energy (E VB) of BT and BTZSH-0.04 ceramics are 1.83 eV and 2.10 eV, respectively. Meanwhile, the values of the conduction bands (E CB) for BT and BTZSH-0.04 ceramics can be calculated as -1.18 eV and -0.98 eV, respectively, according to the following equation. As demonstrated in (d), since the E CB (-0.98 eV) and E VB (2.10 eV) of BTZSH-0.04 ceramic are more negative and positive than the standard redox potential of O2/\u2022O2 E^{\u2212} (\u22120.33 eV vs. NHE) and OHE^{\u2212}/\u2022OH (+ 1.9 eV vs. NHE) , the redox reactions can be triggered automatically to produce plentiful \u2022O2 E^{\u2212} and \u2022OH with the existence of CB electrons and VB holes on the surface of BTZSH-0.04 ceramic. In contrast, the EVB of BT (1.83 eV) is blow the standard redox potential of OHE^{\u2212}/\u2022OH (+ 1.9 eV vs. NHE) which is insufficient to stimulate the oxidation reaction of OHE^{\u2212}/\u2022OH, leading to a relatively sluggish degradation efficiency of dyes. Furthermore, the intrinsic charge transfer resistance in BT and BTZSH-0.04 ceramic is characterized by EIS tests, as explicated in (e). The arc radius on the EIS Nyquist plot is positively associated with resistance. Apparently, a smaller arc radius of BTZSH-0.04 ceramic than that of BT signifies the lower charge transfer resistance and the more expeditious transmission of electrons and holes in BTZSH-0.04 ceramic, contributing to the enhancement of catalytic activity. Since the carrier separation efficiency affects the catalytic activity, the transient piezoelectric current curves of BT and BTZSH-0.04 ceramics were tested, as shown in (f). Apparently, the BTZSH-0.04 ceramic exhibits much higher transient piezoelectric current response than that of the BT, indicating that the BTZSH-0.04 ceramic possess more efficient electron-hole pairs separation and transmission , resulting in significantly improved piezo-catalytic activity for organic dye. Based on these foregoing elaborations, the excellent catalytic mechanism of BTZSH-0.04 ceramic can be speculated as displayed in. The BTZSH-0.04 ceramic with modulated phase boundary, profitable energy band structure and lower charge transfer resistance generates more easier separation and more expeditious migration of electron-hole pairs under the actuation of ultrasonic vibration due to the piezoelectric effect. More abundant \u2022O2 E^{\u2212} and \u2022OH radicals are created by the redox reactions of electrons on the CB with O2 and holes on the VB with OHE^{\u2212}.

The ion doping alters the phase boundary of BaTiO3 ceramics and a two-phase coexistence of rhombohedral-orthorhombic is achieved at room temperature in BTZSH-0.04 ceramic. Consequently, the BTZSH-0.04 ceramic exhibits an excellent degradation efficiency of rhodamine B with 97.27% in 60min and a high reaction rate constant of 0.056 min−1 under ultrasonication which is 7.4 times more than that of pristine BaTiO3.

# INTRODUCTION
Numerous researches have been conducted to estimate the catalytic degradation performances of organic pollutants of four representative lead-free perovskite piezoelectric ceramics containing BaTiO3-based , BiFeO3-based , K0.5Na0.5NbO3-based  and Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3-based. For instance, Huang et al. improved the rate constant of piezoelectric-photocatalysis from 0.009 minE^{\u22121} to 0.032 minE^{\u22121} by doping Mo atoms in BiFeO3. Xiao et al. improved the piezoelectric-photocatalytic activity of BT by introducing surface oxygen vacancies through annealing. Mohd Ali et al. improved the degradation efficiency of RhB by constructing a BaTiO3-MoS2 heterostructure, reaching 80% in 120 min. Huang et al. synthesized BT with different platform-like nano/microstructures by controlling pH and increased the rate constant for dye degradation to 0.0155 minE^{\u22121}. Xie et al. polarized the KNN-based material, increasing the rate constant of RhB by 2.44 times. Subsequently, electrons and holes react respectively with dissolved oxygen and OHE^{\u2212}/H2O in solution to form reactive oxygen species (ROS). Finally, the redox reaction between ROS and pollutant will degrade the macromolecules into micromolecules or CO2 and H2O. BaTiO3 (BT) is a typical ferroelectric material with fascinating advantages of stable structure, excellent performance, simple composition and environmental friendliness , which makes it an ideal material as a piezoelectric catalyst. In this work, we employ phase boundary engineering to construct a novel BaTi(1- x )(Zr1/3Sn1/3Hf1/3) x O3 (BTZSH-x, x=0.00, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08) system by doping Zr, Sn, and Hf into the B-site of BT using conventional solid-phase method. The ion doping generates a variation of phase structure of the BTZSH-x ceramics and a coexistence of rhombohedral-orthorhombic (R-O) phases is achieved in BTZSH-0.04 ceramic. Compared to tetragonal BT ceramic with few spontaneous polarization directions and high polarization rotation energy, the multiphase coexistence in BTZSH-0.04 ceramic increases the spontaneous polarization directions and declines the polarization rotation energy barrier, exhibiting an enhanced piezo-catalytic activity, as shown in. The degradation efficiency of rhodamine B (RhB) is increased from 36.14% for BT to 97.27% for BTZSH-0.04 at 60 min, accompanied with an excellent cycling stability.

# CONCLUSION
In this work, novel BTZSH-x ceramics have been prepared by ion doping to modulate the phase boundary to enhance the piezo-catalytic activities. As a result, an excellent piezo-catalytic performance has been achieved in BTZSH-0.04 ceramic with outstanding degradation capability of RhB (97.27% at 60 min) and high k-value (0.056 minE^{\u22121}) which is 7.4 times more than that of BaTiO3, accompanied by a preeminent cycling stability.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
(a) illustrates the XRD spectra of BTZSH-x (x = 0.00 \u2013 0.08) ceramics and gives the standard cards of rhombic (R) phase (BaTiO3 PDF#85-1790), orthogonal (O) phase (BaTiO3 PDF#81-2200) and tetragonal (T) phase (BaTiO3 PDF#81-2201). All ceramic samples exhibit a typical perovskite phase without obvious impurities existence, suggesting a successful incorporation of the doped elements into the BT lattice. By comparing the local enlarged XRD spectra in (b) with the standard card, it can be seen that the ceramics undergo a phase transition from T-phase to O-phase and then to R-phase as x increases. When x = 0.00, the (200) peak splits into two peaks of (002) and (200), confirming the tetragonal phase of the BT. As x increases to 0.02, the (200) peak splits into (220) and (200), indicating the phase transition from T-phase to O-phase. With further increase of x, the R-phase appears and a coexistence of R-O ferroelectric phases can be observed in BTZSH-0.04 ceramic. As x is further increased to 0.06, the characteristic peak of O-phase disappears and the ceramic exists in the form of R-phase. To further confirm the coexistence of two phases (R-O) in BTZSH-0.04 ceramic, a Rietveld refinement of the corresponding XRD spectrum is carried out using GSAS software and the results are shown in (c). The fitting results exhibit that the proportions of R and O phases for BTZSH-0.04 ceramic are 19.47% and 80.53%, indicating the coexistence of R and O phases which is consistent with the XRD measurements. Twelve optical modes (3F1u+F2u) exist for barium titanate in cubic phase. When transformed into tetragonal phase, F1u and F2u split into (A1+E) and (B1+E) modes with Raman activity, respectively. Owing to the long term electrostatic forces in the lattice, (A1+E) splits further into transverse (TO) and longitudinal (LO) components. (a) shows the Raman spectra of BTZSH-x (x = 0.00 \u2013 0.08) at room temperature. When undoped, the characteristic modes of tetragonal phase are observed, including E(TO1), A1(TO1), A1(TO2), E(TO2), A1(TO3) and A1(LO3)/E(LO) at \u223c118 cmE^{\u22121}, \u223c193 cmE^{\u22121}, \u223c260 cmE^{\u22121}, \u223c306 cmE^{\u22121}, \u223c518 cmE^{\u22121} and \u223c718 cmE^{\u22121}, respectively. Although it is difficult to distinguish the T-phase from the O-phase in Raman spectroscopy, the reinforcement of A1(TO1) peak and the attenuation of A1(TO2) peak are sufficient to certify the occurrence of phase transition from T-phase to O-phase from x = 0.00 to x=0.02. when x \u2265 0.04, the A1(LO) vibrational mode arises at about 143 cmE^{\u22121} along with a vanishment of the A1(TO2) vibrational mode, manifesting the emergence of R phase, as shown in (b). The above-mentioned evidence further demonstrates a two-phase coexistence of R and O phases in BTZSH-0.04 ceramic.. illustrates the microstructure and grain sizes of BTZSH-x ceramics. By observing (a-e), it can be concluded that the BT-based ceramics are all well sintered, forming a dense microstructure and a visible grain boundary with low porosity. The average grain sizes (AG) of the BT-based ceramics calculated using nano measure software as explained in (f) exhibit a slight fluctuation around 25\u03bcm-45\u03bcm, implying that tiny amount of ion doping generates a small effect on the grain growth. (g-h) display that the BT and BTZSH-0.04 ceramic powder possess a similar particle size, meaning that the difference of specific surface area and contact area with solutions is negligible. The elemental distribution of BTZSH-0.04 ceramic is further characterized using EDS elemental mapping. Surface elemental composition and valence of the BTZSH-0.04 sample are characterized by XPS as exhibited in. The peaks with binding energies of 794.55 eV and 779.18 eV in (a) belong to Ba 3d3/2 and Ba 3d5/2, respectively, which correspond to BaE^{2+}. In (b), the characteristic peaks of Ti 2p are at 463.90 eV and 458.12 eV, which are attributed to TiE^{4+}. There are two characteristic peaks of O1s in (c). The O1s peak at 529.44 eV is ascribed to the lattice oxygen in the chalcogenide environment, whereas the O1s peak at 531.25 eV is caused by oxygen vacancies. (d) reveals two characteristic peaks of Zr 3d located at 181.38eV (3d 5/2) and 183.76eV (3d 3/2), which associate with the Zr element within +4 chemical state. The Sn 3d spectrum in (e) exhibits two peaks at 486.18 eV and 494.65 eV, corresponding separately to Sn 2p3/2 and Sn 2p1/2 of SnE^{4+}. Moreover, the HfE^{4+} can be confirmed by the signals of Hf 4f7/2 and Hf 4f5/2 are at 15.28 eV and 17.28 eV in (f), respectively. These results indicate that all elements exist as expected and the Zr, Sn and Hf elements are successfully doped into the B-site of BaTiO3. To further clarify the influence of doping on the phase transition of the BTZSH-x ceramics, the temperature dependences of dielectric permittivity (\u03b5 r) are measured and expressed in. Three dielectric peaks can be detected in BT corresponding to the rhombic-orthogonal phase transition (T R-O), the orthogonal-tetragonal phase transition (T O-T) and the Curie temperature (T C). The BTZSH-0.02 ceramic presents a crystalline phase of O-phase at room temperature. When x = 0.04, the T R-O is close to room temperature and the phase transition from R-phase to O-phase may not be completed thoroughly, rendering the BTZSH-0.04 ceramic a coexistence of two ferroelectric phases (R-O). Nevertheless, the T R-O disappears and only the T R-T and T C are observed at x=0.06. With further increase of x, the BTZSH-0.08 ceramic only possesses single dielectric peak (T C) and presents as R-phase at room temperature. (f) shows the phase diagram of BTZSH-x ceramics according to the corresponding \u03b5 r-T relationship profiles. Evidently, the incorporation of Zr, Sn, Hf induces a phase transition behavior with the increase of x and a two-phase coexistence of R-O is perceived near room temperature in BTZSH-0.04 ceramic, validating the analysis of XRD and Raman tests. illustrates the piezoelectric coefficient (d 33) of BTZSH-x ceramics. For BT with single tetragonal phase, the d 33 is only 100+ pC/N. After ion doping, the d 33 of BT-based ceramics increases significantly and reaches the maximum of 350 pC/N in BTZSH-0.04 ceramic. As everyone knows, the polarization directions of T-phase in <001>, R-phase in <111> and O-phase in <110> are 6, 12 and 8, respectively. The catalytic properties of the BTZSH-x ceramics are appraised by degradation of RhB (10mg/L) under ultrasonic vibration. The initial concentration (C 0) after the adsorption-desorption equilibrium and the instantaneous concentration at reaction time t (C t) are calculated according to the UV absorbance at \u223c554nm at certain intervals and the time-resolution degradation efficiency is identified by (C 0-C t)/C 0. Explicitly, the pristine BT ceramic exerts a poor degradation ability while the concentration of RhB solution expresses a remarkable decrease with the increase of ultrasound time for BTZSH-0.04 ceramic as exhibited. By contrast with the undoped BT ceramic, the doped ones illustrate a distinct promotion of degradation efficiency as displayed in (b), indicating that the variation of phase boundary induced by phase transition after doping strengthens the piezo-catalytic activity. Particularly, the BTZSH-0.04 ceramic achieves the optimal catalytic performance with 97.27% at 60min. The kinetics of the degradation process is consistent with a pseudo-primary reaction and is expressed as ln (C t/C 0) =-kt , where k is a first-order kinetic constant representing the rate of degradation, which can be obtained directly by a linear fitting of -ln(C t/C 0) to t. From (c), it can be seen that the degradation rate of RhB by the doped samples is greater than that of the pure BT. On the other hand, the phase transformation from single-phase in BT to multiphase coexistence (R-O) in BTZSH-0.04 ceramic generates increscent spontaneous polarization directions and decrescent polarization rotation energy. Consequently, the maximum degradation rate of 0.056 minE^{\u22121} is observed in BTZSH-0.04 ceramic, which is 7.4 times than that of BT, as illustrated in (d). With further increase of x to 0.08, the BTZSH-0.08 ceramic is R-phase without the existence of multiphase coexistence region, exposing an explicit deterioration of degradation efficiency. Therefore, the degradation capability of different initial concentrations of RhB and various typical dyes by BTZSH-0.04 ceramic is investigated to evaluate its utilization potentiality. As conveyed in (a-c), the degradation ability of BTZSH-0.04 ceramic is inversely related to the initial concentration of RhB. The degradation efficiency of RhB with different initial concentration of 10 mg/L, 20 mg/L, and 30 mg/L is 97.27%, 71.26%, and 40.33%, respectively. An increase in the initial concentration of dye may exceed the capacity of the active sites, leading to a decrease in the piezoelectric catalytic efficiency. (d\u223cf) demonstrate the catalytic degradation properties of different dyes containing RhB, methylene blue (MB) and methyl orange (MO) with the concentration of 10 mg/L. The degradation efficiency of RhB, MB and MO at 60 min is 97.27%, 39.52% and 62.5%, respectively. The inferior degradation efficiency of MB and MO may be imputed to the distinction of their molecular structures with RhB, where the C=N and N=N double bonds add the degradation difficulty. Hence, the cyclability tests of BTZSH-0.04 powder are performed by five degradation cycles of 10mg/L RhB solution as illustrated in (a-b). Fortunately, the BTZSH-0.04 ceramic displays a fascinating catalytic cyclability of more than 90% after undergoing five cycles. The XRD spectra of BTZSH-0.04 ceramic before and after five cycles demonstrate no obvious change of crystal structure, implying its fine stability as a promising selection for wastewater treatment. In addition, reveals the comparison of piezo-catalytic performance of the BTZSH-0.04 ceramic with other common lead-free piezocatalytic materials. Compared with most other lead-free piezocatalysts, the BTZSH-0.04 ceramic in this work displays an excellent degradation ability of organic dye, which encourages its prospective applications for environmental modification. Reactive substances are critical roles in piezocatalysis and their function can be elucidated through introducing diverse radical scavengers into BTZSH-0.04 ceramic reaction system. Benzoquinone (BQ), isopropanol (IPA) and Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt (EDTA-2Na) are served as scavengers of superoxide radical (\u2027O2 E^{\u2212}), hydroxyl radical (\u2027OH) and holes (hE^{+}), respectively. As shown in (a), the degradation capability is greatly inhibited by the addition of BQ, signifying that \u2027O2 E^{\u2212} is the main dominant active species in the degradation procedure. The impact of \u2027OH also cannot be neglected with a certain suppression capability on degrading RhB while hE^{+} plays a minor role in the degradation experiment. Generally, the energy band structure of semiconductors can impose a significant impact on their electronic motion and their catalytic capability is dependent on the valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) potential. UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy is employed to evaluate the band structure of BT and BTZSH-0.04 ceramics as shown in (a), and the bandgap values are calculated based on the Tauc formula as follows : where \u03b1, h, \u03bd, E g and A are the absorption coefficient, Planck's constant, frequency of the incident light, bandgap, and absorption constant, respectively. In the inset of (a), the E g values can be obtained by extrapolating the linear part of the Tauc plot to the energy axis, and those of BT and BTZSH-0.04 ceramics are 3.01 eV and 3.08 eV, respectively, indicating a slight increase in the band gap value after doping. To further figure out the energy band structure, the valence band XPS spectra of BT and BTZSH-0.04 ceramics are measured as implied in (b-c). The valence band energy (E VB) of BT and BTZSH-0.04 ceramics are 1.83 eV and 2.10 eV, respectively. Meanwhile, the values of the conduction bands (E CB) for BT and BTZSH-0.04 ceramics can be calculated as -1.18 eV and -0.98 eV, respectively, according to the following equation. As demonstrated in (d), since the E CB (-0.98 eV) and E VB (2.10 eV) of BTZSH-0.04 ceramic are more negative and positive than the standard redox potential of O2/\u2022O2 E^{\u2212} (\u22120.33 eV vs. NHE) and OHE^{\u2212}/\u2022OH (+ 1.9 eV vs. NHE) , the redox reactions can be triggered automatically to produce plentiful \u2022O2 E^{\u2212} and \u2022OH with the existence of CB electrons and VB holes on the surface of BTZSH-0.04 ceramic. In contrast, the EVB of BT (1.83 eV) is blow the standard redox potential of OHE^{\u2212}/\u2022OH (+ 1.9 eV vs. NHE) which is insufficient to stimulate the oxidation reaction of OHE^{\u2212}/\u2022OH, leading to a relatively sluggish degradation efficiency of dyes. Furthermore, the intrinsic charge transfer resistance in BT and BTZSH-0.04 ceramic is characterized by EIS tests, as explicated in (e). The arc radius on the EIS Nyquist plot is positively associated with resistance. Apparently, a smaller arc radius of BTZSH-0.04 ceramic than that of BT signifies the lower charge transfer resistance and the more expeditious transmission of electrons and holes in BTZSH-0.04 ceramic, contributing to the enhancement of catalytic activity. Since the carrier separation efficiency affects the catalytic activity, the transient piezoelectric current curves of BT and BTZSH-0.04 ceramics were tested, as shown in (f). Apparently, the BTZSH-0.04 ceramic exhibits much higher transient piezoelectric current response than that of the BT, indicating that the BTZSH-0.04 ceramic possess more efficient electron-hole pairs separation and transmission , resulting in significantly improved piezo-catalytic activity for organic dye. Based on these foregoing elaborations, the excellent catalytic mechanism of BTZSH-0.04 ceramic can be speculated as displayed in. The BTZSH-0.04 ceramic with modulated phase boundary, profitable energy band structure and lower charge transfer resistance generates more easier separation and more expeditious migration of electron-hole pairs under the actuation of ultrasonic vibration due to the piezoelectric effect. More abundant \u2022O2 E^{\u2212} and \u2022OH radicals are created by the redox reactions of electrons on the CB with O2 and holes on the VB with OHE^{\u2212}.

The ion doping alters the phase boundary of BaTiO3 ceramics and a two-phase coexistence of rhombohedral-orthorhombic is achieved at room temperature in BTZSH-0.04 ceramic. Consequently, the BTZSH-0.04 ceramic exhibits an excellent degradation efficiency of rhodamine B with 97.27% in 60min and a high reaction rate constant of 0.056 min−1 under ultrasonication which is 7.4 times more than that of pristine BaTiO3.

# INTRODUCTION
Numerous researches have been conducted to estimate the catalytic degradation performances of organic pollutants of four representative lead-free perovskite piezoelectric ceramics containing BaTiO3-based , BiFeO3-based , K0.5Na0.5NbO3-based  and Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3-based. For instance, Huang et al. improved the rate constant of piezoelectric-photocatalysis from 0.009 minE^{\u22121} to 0.032 minE^{\u22121} by doping Mo atoms in BiFeO3. Xiao et al. improved the piezoelectric-photocatalytic activity of BT by introducing surface oxygen vacancies through annealing. Mohd Ali et al. improved the degradation efficiency of RhB by constructing a BaTiO3-MoS2 heterostructure, reaching 80% in 120 min. Huang et al. synthesized BT with different platform-like nano/microstructures by controlling pH and increased the rate constant for dye degradation to 0.0155 minE^{\u22121}. Xie et al. polarized the KNN-based material, increasing the rate constant of RhB by 2.44 times. Subsequently, electrons and holes react respectively with dissolved oxygen and OHE^{\u2212}/H2O in solution to form reactive oxygen species (ROS). Finally, the redox reaction between ROS and pollutant will degrade the macromolecules into micromolecules or CO2 and H2O. BaTiO3 (BT) is a typical ferroelectric material with fascinating advantages of stable structure, excellent performance, simple composition and environmental friendliness , which makes it an ideal material as a piezoelectric catalyst. In this work, we employ phase boundary engineering to construct a novel BaTi(1- x )(Zr1/3Sn1/3Hf1/3) x O3 (BTZSH-x, x=0.00, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08) system by doping Zr, Sn, and Hf into the B-site of BT using conventional solid-phase method. The ion doping generates a variation of phase structure of the BTZSH-x ceramics and a coexistence of rhombohedral-orthorhombic (R-O) phases is achieved in BTZSH-0.04 ceramic. Compared to tetragonal BT ceramic with few spontaneous polarization directions and high polarization rotation energy, the multiphase coexistence in BTZSH-0.04 ceramic increases the spontaneous polarization directions and declines the polarization rotation energy barrier, exhibiting an enhanced piezo-catalytic activity, as shown in. The degradation efficiency of rhodamine B (RhB) is increased from 36.14% for BT to 97.27% for BTZSH-0.04 at 60 min, accompanied with an excellent cycling stability.

# CONCLUSION
In this work, novel BTZSH-x ceramics have been prepared by ion doping to modulate the phase boundary to enhance the piezo-catalytic activities. As a result, an excellent piezo-catalytic performance has been achieved in BTZSH-0.04 ceramic with outstanding degradation capability of RhB (97.27% at 60 min) and high k-value (0.056 minE^{\u22121}) which is 7.4 times more than that of BaTiO3, accompanied by a preeminent cycling stability.
