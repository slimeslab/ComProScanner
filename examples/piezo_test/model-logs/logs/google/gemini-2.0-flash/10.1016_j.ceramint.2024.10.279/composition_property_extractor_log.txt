# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The XRD pattern and SEM image of the NN templates particles used to texture KNNS-(0.04-x)CZ-xBAZ ceramics are shown in. It can be seen from (a), the NN templates present a single tetragonal perovskite structure without any trace of secondary phase. Obviously, only <00l>c diffraction peaks were observed in the NN templates, indicating the preferred crystal orientation along <00l>c direction. The SEM image ((b)) shows that the NN templates exhibit a plate-like morphology with a large aspect ratio of \u223c20. Thus, the NN templates can be easily aligned or oriented under the applied shear force during tape-casting. (a) provides the XRD patterns of KNNS-(0.04-x)CZ-xBAZ (x = 0\u20130.03) textured ceramics. Notably, all samples exhibit the dominant perovskite structure, and the x = 0.03 ceramics show the existence of secondary impurity phase as denoted by asterisk symbol, which can be identified as the ZrO2 (PDF #37-0031) phase. A combination of XRD studies and temperature-dependent dielectric permittivity measurements is proposed to determine the phase structure of the samples. (b) presents the temperature-dependent dielectric permittivity (\u03b5r-T) of the textured KNNS-(0.04-x)CZ-xBAZ ceramics. One can see the phase transition temperature of rhombohedral-orthorhombic (denoted as TR-O) is gradually increased, whereas that of the orthorhombic-tetragonal (refer to as TO-T) is monotonously decreased with the increase of x. Consequently, it can be deduced that the phase structure of the textured ceramics with x = 0 is O phase, and transforms into R and O phase coexistence for the textured ceramics with x = 0.01\u20130.02, and ultimately evolves into R, O and T multiphase coexistence when x = 0.03 at room temperature. Rietveld refinements of the XRD patterns of the x = 0\u20130.03 ceramics further confirmed the supposed phase structures are reliable due to the high matching degree (Rwp \u2264 6.32 %, Rp \u2264 4.15 %, and \u03c7E^{2} \u2264 4.32 for all samples) between the test and fitting results, as illustrated in (c). In addition, high relative intensity of (001)/(100) and (002)/(200) diffraction peaks as compared to other peaks ((a)) for all samples suggests the preferred <001> orientation of the grains. The texturing degree F001 was calculated in terms of Lotgering factor using the peak intensities and was found to have values of 83 %, 75 %, 92 % and 82 %, respectively, for the textured ceramics with x = 0\u20130.03. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) inverse pole figure (IPF) ( (a)) and <001> pole figure ((b)) measurements for the representative sample x = 0.03 further confirmed that most grains are well oriented along the <001> direction for the textured ceramic. SEM images of the cross-section of the textured ceramics shown in present that cubic-shaped grains are well aligned along the crystallographic <001> perpendicular to the tape casting direction, which is consistent with the results revealed by XRD measurement. In addition, needle-like pores (marked by the yellow dashed boxes) can be observed in all the textured ceramic, which can be attributed to the reaction of NaNbO3 seeds with the matrix and finally dissolved into the matrix of the ceramics during sintering. The relative densities determined by Archimedes method of all textured ceramics are larger than 93 % ( ), indicating a good densification. It is worth noting that the relative density of the textured ceramics increases with increasing doping content of (Bi0.5Ag0.5)ZrO3, which can be attributed to the sintering aid effect of (Bi0.5Ag0.5)ZrO3. (a) reveals the polarization-electric field (P-E) hysteresis loops for the textured KNNS-(0.04-x)CZ-xBAZ ceramics obtained at the electric field and frequency of 40 kV/cm and 10 Hz, respectively. The coercive fields (Ec) of KNNS-(0.04-x)CZ-xBAZ textured ceramics had a similar magnitude of \u223c8.8 kV/cm, which is much lower than their random counterparts (>12 kV/cm), which is conducive to enhance the polarization degree, and thus achieving superior piezoelectric properties. Furthermore, the composition dependence of the ferroelectric properties is clearly visible, e.g., the Pr values initially increase and then descend with the increase of x, exhibiting a maximum value of approximately 23.4 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at x = 0.02, which may be interpreted in terms of the coexistence of R and O phases. To obtain the large signal piezoelectric coefficient d33\u2217, the unipolar electric-field-induced strains (Suni) were measured and presented in (c). It can be found that the strain values increase from 0.11 % at x = 0 to a maximum of 0.18 % at x = 0.03, corresponding a d33\u2217 (Smax/Emax) of 450 pm/V. The strain hysteresis is defined as \u0394S/Smax, where Smax is the strain at the maximum electric field (Emax) and \u0394S is the difference in the strain at Emax/2. It should be noted that an ultralow strain hysteresis of 5.7 % was observed in the KNNS-0.01CZ-0.03BAZ textured ceramic, which can be interpreted by the stable domain configuration of <001> oriented rhombohedral and orthorhombic crystals under the application of a [001] electric field. The piezoelectric coefficients (d33, g33), and longitudinal-mode coupling factor (k33) of KNNS-(0.04-x)CZ-xBAZ textured ceramics and their non-textured counterparts are given in (d) and (f), respectively. It is worth noting that excellent overall electromechanical-related properties of d33 \u223c 447 pC/N, g33 \u223c 30 \xd7 10E^{\u22123} Vm/N and k33 \u223c 47 % were achieved in the textured ceramics with x = 0.03. Of particular importance is that a large figure-of-merit (d33\xd7g33) value of 13.4 \xd7 10E^{\u221212} mE^{2}/N was detected in the textured ceramics with x = 0.03, which is beneficial to obtain large output power of PEHs. In respect to the textured ceramic with x = 0.03, the polycrystalline phase boundary with a R-O-T multiphase structure lowering the energy barrier to polarization rotation, which allows the ceramics to easily reach a saturated polarization under an external electric field, and thus enhance the piezoelectric response. Furthermore, the piezoelectric anisotropy resulted from the grain orientation along [001], and the favorable \u201c4R\u201d and \u201c4O\u201d engineered domain configurations which are formed by poling the rhombohedral and orthorhombic crystals along [001] direction should contribute to the high piezoelectric properties. In addition, to reveal the extrinsic contribution from the domain morphology viewpoint, we performed TEM measurement for the textured ceramic with x = 0.03. Due to the coexistence of R-O-T phases, complex domain morphology including stripe-like domains ( (a)) feature widths varying from 20 to 100 nm, and hierarchical domain architecture composing of needle-type nanodomains with widths of approximately 5\u201350 nm were clearly observed, as shown in (b). These two kinds of domains have low domain wall energy and almost vanishing polarization anisotropy as well as elastic softening, which can significantly improve the mobility of domain walls under the action of external electric field, and thus enhance the piezoelectric properties. (c) and (d) show the high-resolution lattice fringe diagram and the corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the textured ceramic x = 0.03, exhibiting the ordered arrangement of atoms and the excellent crystalline quality. The crystal planes in (c) can be determined to be (010) and (001) through measuring the interplanar distance. It should be noted that the small signal piezoelectric coefficient d33 can be approximately extracted from the d33(E) loops at E = 0 other than the quasistatic testing. In order to evaluate the temperature stability of d33, the in-situ temperature-dependent d33(E) hysteresis loops were measured, and the results of a representative sample x = 0.03 are displayed in (a). Temperature-dependent d33 values for KNNS-(0.04-x)CZ-xBAZ textured ceramics are summarized in (b). It can be seen the d33 values of the textured ceramics (x = 0\u20130.02) rise significantly in the temperature range of 25 \xb0C - TO-T, and decrease slowly when the temperature exceeds TO-T. On the contrary, the d33 values of x = 0.03 textured ceramics decrease slightly in the temperature range of 25\u201340 \xb0C, and rise gradually in the range of 40\u2013120 \xb0C, where the fluctuation range of d33 is within 11.6 %, demonstrating good temperature stability. It is worth noting here that the x = 0.03 textured ceramic is found to maintain a comparatively large d33 of 511 pm/V up to 120 \xb0C. (c) shows the in-situ temperature dependence of unipolar strain curves for the sample x = 0.03 as an example. Temperature-dependent unipolar strain values for the textured ceramics x = 0\u20130.03 are depicted in (d). The values of Suni of x = 0.03 textured ceramic shows a relatively low deviation of 5.1 % with respect to its room temperature value in the range of 20\u2013120 \xb0C, suggesting extremely excellent temperature stability of strain. The good temperature stability of piezoelectric properties can be ascribed to the persistent contributions of crystal orientation to piezoelectric properties with elevated temperature, and the diffused phase transition between the R, O and T phases due to the disorder of the cations (KE^{+}, NaE^{+}, AgE^{+}, CaE^{2+}, BiE^{3+}) in the cell. To demonstrate practical applications of high-performance KNNS-0.01CZ-0.03BAZ textured ceramics, cantilever-type piezoelectric energy harvester (PEH) was fabricated using KNNS-0.01CZ-0.03BAZ textured ceramics. The schematic diagram of the PEH, which consists mainly of a mechanical vibration control system, a steel bar adhering to a piezoelectric ceramic, and a circuit system of energy harvesting and AC-to-DC rectifying, are shown in (a). The output power and corresponding power density as a function of load resistance of PEH at a resonance frequency of 41 Hz and a fixed acceleration of 2g are given in (b). It can be observed that the output power increased at first and then decreased gradually with the increase of load resistance, as a result a maximum value of 0.46 mW was obtained at a load resistance of approximately 2.4 M\u03a9, which corresponding to a power density of 6.7 mW/cmE^{3}. It is clear that the power density of PEH made from KNNS-0.01CZ-0.03BAZ textured ceramic is better than most previously reported PEHs produced using other lead-free ceramics and even many PZT-based ceramics, as compared in (c) and. High power density of the PEH should be ascribed to the outstanding electromechanical conversion properties (d33 \u223c 447 pC/N, k33 \u223c 47 %) and large d33\xd7g33 (13.4 \xd7 10E^{\u221212} mE^{2}/N) values of the KNNS-0.01CZ-0.03BAZ textured ceramics. It is worth noting that 145 parallel-connected commercial light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which were arranged into the seven letters \u201cLCU SESM\u201d, were successfully lighted up using the output power of the PEH, as shown in (d). Therefore, this work clearly indicates the great potential of KNN-based textured ceramics for energy harvesting applications.

# TITLE
High performance (K,Na)NbO<inf>3</inf>-based textured ceramics for piezoelectric energy harvesting

# ABSTRACT
Piezoelectric energy harvesters (PEHs), which can provide sustainable green energy for low-power electronics have received extensive attention in the viewpoint of science and industrialization. In order to achieve large output power of PEHs, high-performance piezoelectric materials are extremely desired. Herein, excellent electromechanical conversion properties of d33 ∼ 447 pC/N, g33 ∼ 30 × 10−3 Vm/N, k33 ∼ 47 % and Suni ∼0.18 % were achieved in <001> grain aligned KNN-based lead-free ceramics with a favorable rhombohedral (R), orthorhombic (O) and tetragonal (T) multiphase structure. The PEHs fabricated using the optimal performance KNN-based textured ceramics exhibit high output power of 0.46 mW and power density of 6.7 mW/cm3 at a resonant frequency of 41 Hz, which is associated with the large k33 (∼47 %) and figure-of-merit (d33×g33 ∼ 13.4 × 10−12 m2/N) values. The output power can actually light up more than 145 commercial LEDs, demonstrating great potential of KNN-based PEHs to power wireless sensors.

# INTRODUCTION
Piezoelectric energy harvesters (PEHs), which can convert the mechanical energy into electrical energy based on the positive piezoelectric effect have been considered to be a more promising approach to supply the sustainable green power for wireless sensors as compared to conventional batteries. For example, Gao et al. designed shear-mode piezoelectric energy harvester based on PIN-PMN-PT single crystal and successfully powered the LED array and wireless sensors. Jiang and co-authors fabricated lead-free PEHs based on KNN-based ceramics, and which were developed into wearable and bio-implantable device for human motion sensing and percutaneous ultrasound power transmission. Although the PEHs possess great potential in self-powered passive electronics, however, the critical challenge for PEHs to replace batteries is their relatively low output power. Series of studies have indicated that piezoelectric materials and PEHs structure (e.g., energy harvesting circuit; shape and material of cantilever et al.) are two critical factors that determine the output power of PEHs. In general, piezoelectric materials with large piezoelectric charge coefficient (dij), piezoelectric voltage coefficient (gij), and electromechanical coupling coefficient (kij) are required to realize high output power for PEHs on resonance conditions. It is worth noting here that it is a challenge to obtain large values of dij and gij (gij = dij/\u03b5ij) at the same time, due to any increase in dij is usually accompanied with even larger increase in the dielectric permittivity \u03b5ij, and thus giving rise to a decrease of gij. Therefore, some ingenious strategies have be proposed to simultaneously enhance the values of d33 and g33 for piezoelectric ceramics. For example, porous piezoelectric ceramics and piezoelectric composites have been demonstrated to be an effective strategy to enhance g33 values via inhibiting \u03b533 and maintaining high d33 values, and thus realizing excellent energy harvesting performance. Chang and Zhai et al. achieved large values of g33 and figure-of-merit (d33 \xd7 g33) in BCZT and KNN-based textured ceramics, respectively, by significantly improving d33 and maintaining \u03b533 stable or slightly rising using grain orientation engineering. Hou et al. proposed a novel strategy that coupling elastic polarization configuration with activity rattling space in KNN-based ceramics to simultaneously enhance d33 and g33 values, which resulted in a high output power density of 533 \u03bcW/cmE^{3}. Furthermore, the structural design is also a crucial factor affecting the output power of PEHs. For instance, the output power of PEHs can be improved by designing a series connection structure of multiple piezoelectric ceramics as compared to a single ceramic. In this work, in order to achieve high piezoelectric and energy harvesting performance, a strategy of combination of grain orientation and phase structure engineering is proposed for KNN-based lead-free ceramics. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, we selected 0.96(K0.5Na0.5)(Nb0.96Sb0.04)O3-(0.04-x)CaZrO3-x(Bi0.5Ag0.5)ZrO3 (KNNS-(0.04-x)CZ-xBAZ) as an example material. Ultimately, superior electromechanical conversion properties and good temperature stability were achieved in <001> textured KNNS-0.01CZ-0.03BAZ ceramics with R, O and T phases coexistence. Of particular importance is that a relatively large output power and power density were achieved in the PEHs produced using KNNS-0.01CZ-0.03BAZ textured ceramics.

# CONCLUSION
In summary, KNN-(0.04-x)CZ-xBAZ (x = 0\u20130.03) textured ceramics with <001> crystal orientation were synthesized by the TGG method. The phase transition was successfully achieved by regulating the concentration ratio of CZ and BAZ. Outstanding electromechanical conversion properties (d33 \u223c 447 pC/N, g33 \u223c 30 \xd7 10E^{\u22123} Vm/N, k33 \u223c 47 %, Suni \u223c 0.18 %) were achieved in x = 0.03 textured ceramics. In addition, the KNNS-0.01CZ-0.03BAZ textured ceramics have excellent temperature stability, showing the d33 and Suni fluctuations less than 11.6 % and 5.1 %, respectively, from room temperature to 120 \xb0C. The cantilever-structured energy harvester made from KNNS-0.01CZ-0.03BAZ textured ceramics exhibit high output power of 0.46 mW and power density of 6.7 mW/cmE^{3}, which should be originated from the superior electromechanical conversion properties. The PEH can easily light up 145 commercial LEDs by virtue of its high output power. This work opens up new approaches to further improve the electromechanical properties and temperature stability for KNN-based lead-free ceramics by regulating favorable phase structure and crystal orientation.

Consequently, it can be deduced that the phase structure of the textured ceramics with x = 0 is O phase, and transforms into R and O phase coexistence for the textured ceramics with x = 0.01\u20130.02, and ultimately evolves into R, O and T multiphase coexistence when x = 0.03 at room temperature. Rietveld refinements of the XRD patterns of the x = 0\u20130.03 ceramics further confirmed the supposed phase structures are reliable due to the high matching degree (Rwp \u2264 6.32 %, Rp \u2264 4.15 %, and \u03c7E^{2} \u2264 4.32 for all samples) between the test and fitting results, as illustrated in (c).

In addition, needle-like pores (marked by the yellow dashed boxes) can be observed in all the textured ceramic, which can be attributed to the reaction of NaNbO3 seeds with the matrix and finally dissolved into the matrix of the ceramics during sintering. The relative densities determined by Archimedes method of all textured ceramics are larger than 93 % ( ), indicating a good densification. It is worth noting that the relative density of the textured ceramics increases with increasing doping content of (Bi0.5Ag0.5)ZrO3, which can be attributed to the sintering aid effect of (Bi0.5Ag0.5)ZrO3. (a) reveals the polarization-electric field (P-E) hysteresis loops for the textured KNNS-(0.04-x)CZ-xBAZ ceramics obtained at the electric field and frequency of 40 kV/cm and 10 Hz, respectively. The coercive fields (Ec) of KNNS-(0.04-x)CZ-xBAZ textured ceramics had a similar magnitude of \u223c8.8 kV/cm, which is much lower than their random counterparts (>12 kV/cm), which is conducive to enhance the polarization degree, and thus achieving superior piezoelectric properties. Furthermore, the composition dependence of the ferroelectric properties is clearly visible, e.g., the Pr values initially increase and then descend with the increase of x, exhibiting a maximum value of approximately 23.4 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at x = 0.02, which may be interpreted in terms of the coexistence of R and O phases. To obtain the large signal piezoelectric coefficient d33\u2217, the unipolar electric-field-induced strains (Suni) were measured and presented in (c). It can be found that the strain values increase from 0.11 % at x = 0 to a maximum of 0.18 % at x = 0.03, corresponding a d33\u2217 (Smax/Emax) of 450 pm/V. The strain hysteresis is defined as \u0394S/Smax, where Smax is the strain at the maximum electric field (Emax) and \u0394S is the difference in the strain at Emax/2. It should be noted that an ultralow strain hysteresis of 5.7 % was observed in the KNNS-0.01CZ-0.03BAZ textured ceramic, which can be interpreted by the stable domain configuration of <001> oriented rhombohedral and orthorhombic crystals under the application of a [001] electric field. The piezoelectric coefficients (d33, g33), and longitudinal-mode coupling factor (k33) of KNNS-(0.04-x)CZ-xBAZ textured ceramics and their non-textured counterparts are given in (d) and (f), respectively. It is worth noting that excellent overall electromechanical-related properties of d33 \u223c 447 pC/N, g33 \u223c 30 \xd7 10E^{\u22123} Vm/N and k33 \u223c 47 % were achieved in the textured ceramics with x = 0.03. Of particular importance is that a large figure-of-merit (d33\xd7g33) value of 13.4 \xd7 10E^{\u221212} mE^{2}/N was detected in the textured ceramics with x = 0.03, which is beneficial to obtain large output power of PEHs. In respect to the textured ceramic with x = 0.03, the polycrystalline phase boundary with a R-O-T multiphase structure lowering the energy barrier to polarization rotation, which allows the ceramics to easily reach a saturated polarization under an external electric field, and thus enhance the piezoelectric response. Furthermore, the piezoelectric anisotropy resulted from the grain orientation along [001], and the favorable \u201c4R\u201d and \u201c4O\u201d engineered domain configurations which are formed by poling the rhombohedral and orthorhombic crystals along [001] direction should contribute to the high piezoelectric properties. In addition, to reveal the extrinsic contribution from the domain morphology viewpoint, we performed TEM measurement for the textured ceramic with x = 0.03. Due to the coexistence of R-O-T phases, complex domain morphology including stripe-like domains ( (a)) feature widths varying from 20 to 100 nm, and hierarchical domain architecture composing of needle-type nanodomains with widths of approximately 5\u201350 nm were clearly observed, as shown in (b). These two kinds of domains have low domain wall energy and almost vanishing polarization anisotropy as well as elastic softening, which can significantly improve the mobility of domain walls under the action of external electric field, and thus enhance the piezoelectric properties. (c) and (d) show the high-resolution lattice fringe diagram and the corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the textured ceramic x = 0.03, exhibiting the ordered arrangement of atoms and the excellent crystalline quality. The crystal planes in (c) can be determined to be (010) and (001) through measuring the interplanar distance. It should be noted that the small signal piezoelectric coefficient d33 can be approximately extracted from the d33(E) loops at E = 0 other than the quasistatic testing. In order to evaluate the temperature stability of d33, the in-situ temperature-dependent d33(E) hysteresis loops were measured, and the results of a representative sample x = 0.03 are displayed in (a). Temperature-dependent d33 values for KNNS-(0.04-x)CZ-xBAZ textured ceramics are summarized in (b). It can be seen the d33 values of the textured ceramics (x = 0\u20130.02) rise significantly in the temperature range of 25 \xb0C - TO-T, and decrease slowly when the temperature exceeds TO-T. On the contrary, the d33 values of x = 0.03 textured ceramics decrease slightly in the temperature range of 25\u201340 \xb0C, and rise gradually in the range of 40\u2013120 \xb0C, where the fluctuation range of d33 is within 11.6 %, demonstrating good temperature stability. It is worth noting here that the x = 0.03 textured ceramic is found to maintain a comparatively large d33 of 511 pm/V up to 120 \xb0C. (c) shows the in-situ temperature dependence of unipolar strain curves for the sample x = 0.03 as an example. Temperature-dependent unipolar strain values for the textured ceramics x = 0\u20130.03 are depicted in (d). The values of Suni of x = 0.03 textured ceramic shows a relatively low deviation of 5.1 % with respect to its room temperature value in the range of 20\u2013120 \xb0C, suggesting extremely excellent temperature stability of strain. The good temperature stability of piezoelectric properties can be ascribed to the persistent contributions of crystal orientation to piezoelectric properties with elevated temperature, and the diffused phase transition between the R, O and T phases due to the disorder of the cations (KE^{+}, NaE^{+}, AgE^{+}, CaE^{2+}, BiE^{3+}) in the cell. To demonstrate practical applications of high-performance KNNS-0.01CZ-0.03BAZ textured ceramics, cantilever-type piezoelectric energy harvester (PEH) was fabricated using KNNS-0.01CZ-0.03BAZ textured ceramics. The schematic diagram of the PEH, which consists mainly of a mechanical vibration control system, a steel bar adhering to a piezoelectric ceramic, and a circuit system of energy harvesting and AC-to-DC rectifying, are shown in (a). The output power and corresponding power density as a function of load resistance of PEH at a resonance frequency of 41 Hz and a fixed acceleration of 2g are given in (b). It can be observed that the output power increased at first and then decreased gradually with the increase of load resistance, as a result a maximum value of 0.46 mW was obtained at a load resistance of approximately 2.4 M\u03a9, which corresponding to a power density of 6.7 mW/cmE^{3}. It is clear that the power density of PEH made from KNNS-0.01CZ-0.03BAZ textured ceramic is better than most previously reported PEHs produced using other lead-free ceramics and even many PZT-based ceramics, as compared in (c) and. High power density of the PEH should be ascribed to the outstanding electromechanical conversion properties (d33 \u223c 447 pC/N, k33 \u223c 47 %) and large d33\xd7g33 (13.4 \xd7 10E^{\u221212} mE^{2}/N) values of the KNNS-0.01CZ-0.03BAZ textured ceramics. It is worth noting that 145 parallel-connected commercial light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which were arranged into the seven letters \u201cLCU SESM\u201d, were successfully lighted up using the output power of the PEH, as shown in (d). Therefore, this work clearly indicates the great potential of KNN-based textured ceramics for energy harvesting applications.

# TITLE
High performance (K,Na)NbO<inf>3</inf>-based textured ceramics for piezoelectric energy harvesting

# ABSTRACT
Piezoelectric energy harvesters (PEHs), which can provide sustainable green energy for low-power electronics have received extensive attention in the viewpoint of science and industrialization. In order to achieve large output power of PEHs, high-performance piezoelectric materials are extremely desired. Herein, excellent electromechanical conversion properties of d33 ∼ 447 pC/N, g33 ∼ 30 × 10−3 Vm/N, k33 ∼ 47 % and Suni ∼0.18 % were achieved in <001> grain aligned KNN-based lead-free ceramics with a favorable rhombohedral (R), orthorhombic (O) and tetragonal (T) multiphase structure. The PEHs fabricated using the optimal performance KNN-based textured ceramics exhibit high output power of 0.46 mW and power density of 6.7 mW/cm3 at a resonant frequency of 41 Hz, which is associated with the large k33 (∼47 %) and figure-of-merit (d33×g33 ∼ 13.4 × 10−12 m2/N) values. The output power can actually light up more than 145 commercial LEDs, demonstrating great potential of KNN-based PEHs to power wireless sensors.

# INTRODUCTION
Piezoelectric energy harvesters (PEHs), which can convert the mechanical energy into electrical energy based on the positive piezoelectric effect have been considered to be a more promising approach to supply the sustainable green power for wireless sensors as compared to conventional batteries. For example, Gao et al. designed shear-mode piezoelectric energy harvester based on PIN-PMN-PT single crystal and successfully powered the LED array and wireless sensors. Jiang and co-authors fabricated lead-free PEHs based on KNN-based ceramics, and which were developed into wearable and bio-implantable device for human motion sensing and percutaneous ultrasound power transmission. Although the PEHs possess great potential in self-powered passive electronics, however, the critical challenge for PEHs to replace batteries is their relatively low output power. Series of studies have indicated that piezoelectric materials and PEHs structure (e.g., energy harvesting circuit; shape and material of cantilever et al.) are two critical factors that determine the output power of PEHs. In general, piezoelectric materials with large piezoelectric charge coefficient (dij), piezoelectric voltage coefficient (gij), and electromechanical coupling coefficient (kij) are required to realize high output power for PEHs on resonance conditions. It is worth noting here that it is a challenge to obtain large values of dij and gij (gij = dij/\u03b5ij) at the same time, due to any increase in dij is usually accompanied with even larger increase in the dielectric permittivity \u03b5ij, and thus giving rise to a decrease of gij. Therefore, some ingenious strategies have be proposed to simultaneously enhance the values of d33 and g33 for piezoelectric ceramics. For example, porous piezoelectric ceramics and piezoelectric composites have been demonstrated to be an effective strategy to enhance g33 values via inhibiting \u03b533 and maintaining high d33 values, and thus realizing excellent energy harvesting performance. Chang and Zhai et al. achieved large values of g33 and figure-of-merit (d33 \xd7 g33) in BCZT and KNN-based textured ceramics, respectively, by significantly improving d33 and maintaining \u03b533 stable or slightly rising using grain orientation engineering. Hou et al. proposed a novel strategy that coupling elastic polarization configuration with activity rattling space in KNN-based ceramics to simultaneously enhance d33 and g33 values, which resulted in a high output power density of 533 \u03bcW/cmE^{3}. Furthermore, the structural design is also a crucial factor affecting the output power of PEHs. For instance, the output power of PEHs can be improved by designing a series connection structure of multiple piezoelectric ceramics as compared to a single ceramic. In this work, in order to achieve high piezoelectric and energy harvesting performance, a strategy of combination of grain orientation and phase structure engineering is proposed for KNN-based lead-free ceramics. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, we selected 0.96(K0.5Na0.5)(Nb0.96Sb0.04)O3-(0.04-x)CaZrO3-x(Bi0.5Ag0.5)ZrO3 (KNNS-(0.04-x)CZ-xBAZ) as an example material. Ultimately, superior electromechanical conversion properties and good temperature stability were achieved in <001> textured KNNS-0.01CZ-0.03BAZ ceramics with R, O and T phases coexistence. Of particular importance is that a relatively large output power and power density were achieved in the PEHs produced using KNNS-0.01CZ-0.03BAZ textured ceramics.

# CONCLUSION
In summary, KNN-(0.04-x)CZ-xBAZ (x = 0\u20130.03) textured ceramics with <001> crystal orientation were synthesized by the TGG method. The phase transition was successfully achieved by regulating the concentration ratio of CZ and BAZ. Outstanding electromechanical conversion properties (d33 \u223c 447 pC/N, g33 \u223c 30 \xd7 10E^{\u22123} Vm/N, k33 \u223c 47 %, Suni \u223c 0.18 %) were achieved in x = 0.03 textured ceramics. In addition, the KNNS-0.01CZ-0.03BAZ textured ceramics have excellent temperature stability, showing the d33 and Suni fluctuations less than 11.6 % and 5.1 %, respectively, from room temperature to 120 \xb0C. The cantilever-structured energy harvester made from KNNS-0.01CZ-0.03BAZ textured ceramics exhibit high output power of 0.46 mW and power density of 6.7 mW/cmE^{3}, which should be originated from the superior electromechanical conversion properties. The PEH can easily light up 145 commercial LEDs by virtue of its high output power. This work opens up new approaches to further improve the electromechanical properties and temperature stability for KNN-based lead-free ceramics by regulating favorable phase structure and crystal orientation.
