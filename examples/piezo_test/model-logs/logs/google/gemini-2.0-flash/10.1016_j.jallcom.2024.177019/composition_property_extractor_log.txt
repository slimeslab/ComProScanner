# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
To examine the influence of Nd doping as well as PT content on the piezoelectric performance of BS-PT ceramics, 0.02Nd: BS-xPT (x = 0.62, 0.63, 0.64, and 0.65) ceramics were fabricated. (a) illustrates the XRD patterns for 0.02Nd: BS-xPT as a function of PT content. This observation implies the complete incorporation of NdE^{3+} into the crystal lattices of BS-PT. Utilizing the differences in characteristic splitting between rhombohedral and tetragonal phases, the pseudo-cubic (200) diffraction peak serves as a preliminary indicator for the evolution of phase structures. The XRD profiles in (a) reveal that the average symmetry of the examined compositions (x = 0.62, 0.63, 0.64, 0.65, and 0.66) evolves from rhombohedral to tetragonal with increasing PT content. The MPB in 0.02Nd: BS-xPT is observed to be around x = 0.64, consistent with that in the literature. (b) illustrates the changes in d 33 and k p for 0.02Nd: BS-xPT ceramics with respect to PT content. Remarkably, d 33 exhibits an initial increase followed by a decrease with the rise in PT content, reaching its peak value of 550 pC/N at x = 0.64, whereas k p shows minimal variation, maintaining a level around 0.5. Although the variation in k p is relatively modest, the overall trend demonstrates an initial increase followed by a decrease as PT content varies, featuring the typical enhancement of electromechanical properties near the MPB. The maximum k p is observed at x = 0.65, in contrast to the maximum d 33 , which occurs at x = 0.64. The peak values of the coupling factor and piezoelectric constant occur at different compositions, within approximately 1 % mol. Similar studies have been reported in Nb-doped PSN-PT and Sm-doped PMN-PT systems. Upon comparison with the undoped BS-xPT ceramics reported in the literatures , it is evident that Nd doping significantly enhances the piezoelectric properties of BS-xPT ceramics. This enhancement in electrical properties observed in 0.02Nd-doped BS-xPT may primarily result from the local structural heterogeneity induced by Nd doping, leading to a smoothing of the thermodynamic energy profile. In (a), the temperature-dependent dielectric constant (\u03b5 r ) of 0.02Nd: BS-xPT samples is depicted for various PT contents. Additionally, (b) illustrates the changes in the room temperature dielectric constant (\u03b5 r ), the temperature associated with the maximum dielectric constant (T m ), and the temperature variation (\u0394T m ) for 0.02Nd: BS-xPT ceramics with varying PT contents. The \u03b5 r of 0.02Nd: BS-xPT ceramics experience a slight decrease with the rise in PT content, whereas T m increases. In conjunction with the phase structure evolution depicted in (a), the increase in PT content corresponds to a transformation of the phase structure towards the tetragonal phase. Thus, the increased T m is attributed to the elevated Curie temperature (490 \xb0C) of tetragonal PT. Through a comparable doping level (0.02Nd), an increased PT content stabilizes the tetragonal phase while diminishing the extent of structural heterogeneity. The parameter \u0394T m , defined as the disparity between T m values measured at 1 kHz and 1 MHz, is employed to evaluate the relaxation behavior. It exhibits a declining trend with the increase in PT content, providing evidence for diminishing structural heterogeneity. The P-E hysteresis loops and the variation of characteristic parameters of 0.02Nd: BS-xPT with different PT content are recorded at 1 Hz and depicted in (c) and (d). All compositions display well-saturated loops, signifying the robust ferroelectric properties of 0.02Nd: BS-xPT ceramics. The variations in saturation polarization (P max ) and remnant polarization (P r ) exhibit a congruent trend with the increasing PT content, characterized by an initial augmentation followed by a subsequent decline. The pinnacle of P max and P r , as well as the trough of E c , are identified at x = 0.64. As a result of a more refined alignment of spontaneous polarization at MPB, the ceramics exhibit an augmented remnant polarization. This enhancement further facilitates the poling process, as demonstrated by the PT-dependent behaviors of d 33 and k p , as illustrated in (b). Nd doping proves highly effective in elevating the electrical performance of 0.02Nd: BS-xPT ceramics, reaching its zenith at x = 0.64. Our investigation delves deeper into the impact of Nd content on the phase structure, microscopic structure, and electrical properties of yNd: BS-0.64PT ceramics. The XRD patterns of yNd: BS-0.64PT ceramics at room temperature are presented in (a). The distinctive diffraction lines of pure perovskite reveal the successful incorporation of varied concentrations of NdE^{3+} into the lattice of BS-64PT. Upon closer examination of the magnified (002) diffraction profile in (a), a subtle shift towards higher angles is discernible in the (002) diffraction peak. This is due to the ionic radius falling within the range between BiE^{3+} (1.03 \xc5) and ScE^{3+} (0.75 \xc5), prompting NdE^{3+} (0.983 \xc5) to preferentially substitute for BiE^{3+} at the A-site. This induces volume contraction, consequently diminishing the interplanar spacing, providing evidence that NdE^{3+} indeed incorporates into the lattice. The extent of splitting in the (002) diffraction peak was assessed by employing Gaussian-Lorentz fitting, facilitating the discernment of individual phases near the MPB, as shown in (b)-(e). Given that all samples exhibit the characteristics of two-phase coexistence, the diffraction peak observed near 45\xb0 results from the superposition of characteristic peaks corresponding to the tetragonal and rhombohedral phases. Namely, the (002)T and (200)T corresponding to the tetragonal phase, while the (200)R peak is associated with the rhombohedral phase. The phase fractions in ceramics with varying Nd content can be determined using the following equations : where I (002) T and I (200) T represent the intensity of the two diffraction peaks corresponding to the T phase, respectively, while I (200) R refers to the intensity of the diffraction peak corresponding to the R phase. The fitting results reveal a continual rise in the proportion of the tetragonal phase with the increasing content of Nd, as concluded in (f). (a\u2013d) depicts the fracture surface microstructure of yNd: BS-0.64PT ceramics. The grain size distribution determined using Nano Measurer software corresponded with the Gaussian distribution function, as shown in (e\u2013h). The ceramics with a composition of yNd: BS-0.64PT demonstrated nuanced variations in average grain sizes: 2.67 \u03bcm (y = 0.01), 2.55 \u03bcm (y = 0.02), 2.91 \u03bcm (y = 0.03), and 3.29 \u03bcm (y = 0.04). With an escalation in Nd content, there is a concurrent reduction in sintering temperature, thereby, under identical sintering conditions, resulting in the enlargement of grain size. (e\u2013h) present the bulk density data of yNd: BS-0.64PT ceramics, using the Archimedes principle. It can be observed that the sample with y = 0.02 exhibits the highest value. The achievement of the most densely packed microstructure is associated with the optimal substitution level of Nd ions with y = 0.02. (a\u2013d) presents an examination of the dielectric response in yNd: BS-0.64PT ceramics, showcasing their temperature dependence across various frequencies. In samples featuring diverse Nd doping levels, a conspicuous frequency dispersion below T m (the temperature corresponding to the maximum dielectric constant) signifies the presence of relaxor characteristics attributed to PNRs. The extent of diffusive phase transitions can be quantitatively examined by fitting ln(1/\u03b5 r -1/\u03b5 m ) against ln(T-T m ) according to illustrated in the insets of (a\u2013d). where \u03b3 represents the slope of the fitting curves, \u03b5 T signifies the dielectric permittivity at different temperatures, T denotes the measure temperature, \u03b5 m indicates the maximum value of \u03b5 T , T m (@1 kHz) is the temperature at which it occurs, and C stands for the Curie Weiss constant. And \u03b3 varies between 1 and 2 for the normal ferroelectrics and ideal relaxor ferroelectrics, respectively. As the Nd content increases, there is a gradual rise in the \u03b3 value, suggesting an intensified diffusive phase transition. Nevertheless, it should be emphasized that diffusive phase transitions are characteristics of relaxors, with frequency dispersion being their fundamental nature, which can be relatively quantified through \u0394T m (the difference between T m at 1 kHz and 1 MHz). (f) visually depicts the variation of \u0394T m , room temperature dielectric constant (\u03b5 r ), and T m with changing Nd content. As the Nd content increases, there is a steady rise in \u0394T m , indicating an intensified frequency dispersion of the dielectric constant in yNd: BS-0.64PT ceramics. The introduction of NdE^{3+} ions into BS-0.64PT ceramics contributes to a more pronounced compositional disorder, leading to chemical inhomogeneity and the subsequent emergence of PNRs. The dielectric constant \u03b5 r exhibits a continuous rise as the Nd content increases. The heterogenous PNRs induced by Nd doping introduce additional interfacial energy in the system, thereby flattening the average free energy curve and consequently enhancing the dielectric properties. This enhancement comes with a trade-off of a lowered T m , attributed to the disruption of the long-range order by the introduction of Nd. (a) elucidates the changes in piezoelectric coefficients in yNd: BS-0.64PT ceramics as a function of Nd content. The ceramic with 0.02Nd doping in BS-0.64PT demonstrates a maximum d 33 value of 550 pC/N, significantly surpassing the corresponding value for undoped BS-0.64PT ceramics. The piezoelectric voltage coefficient g 33 exhibits a maximum value at y = 0.02, reaching 39.8 (\xd710E^{\u22123} V m/N), which is significantly higher than that of commercial PZT-5A ceramics (24.8\xd710E^{\u22123} V m/N) and even slightly exceeds that observed in PMN-0.30PT single crystal (34.2\xd710E^{\u22123} V m/N) , demonstrating excellent sensitive capabilities. offers a detailed comparison of d 33 and T m values of 0.02Nd: BS-PT ceramics with other BS-PT-based and commercial PZT ceramics. It can be seen that the enhancement in piezoelectric properties of these modified BS-PT ceramics appears to be limited, with certain modifications even resulting in performance degradation. This could be intricately linked to the optimal densification of the microstructure, variations in phase components near the MPB in yNd: BS-0.64PT ceramics, and the induced local structural heterogeneity resulting from Nd doping. The ferroelectric characteristics of yNd: BS-0.64PT ceramics with different Nd concentrations were examined under room temperature conditions. The unipolar strain curves under 4 kV/mm at 1 Hz were shown in (b). The maximum strain at is 0.248 % at y = 0.02, and its corresponding effective piezoelectric coefficient d 33 * (the ratio of the maximum strain and the maximum electric field) is as high as 620 pm/V. The value of d 33 * is larger than that of d 33 , which was also observed in many lead-based piezoceramics. This is due to the fact that the electric-field-induced strain not only from the piezoelectric effect but also domain switching. (c) presents the stain curves under different electric fields of 2, 3, and 4 kV/mm, along with the corresponding maximum stain values. A comparison with commercials PZT ceramics, undoped BS-64PT, and PMN-PT ceramics shows that 0.02Nd: BS-PT ceramic exhibits superior stain response. (d) and (e) depict a comprehensive comparison of P-E and I-E curves, while (f) illustrates the variations in P max , P r , and E c at various Nd content. Combining with I-E curves, with a specific focus on the evolution of current peaks (providing insights into the internal domain switching), allows for the extraction of valuable information regarding the material\u2019s internal microstructural evolution at the domain structure level, induced by the introduction of Nd. Notably, compositions y = 0.02 and y = 0.03 display a characteristic of splitting, with a shoulder adjacent to the main peak. This feature is more pronounced at y = 0.02. Conversely, components y = 0.01 and y = 0.04 present a singular current peak. For y = 0.01, the I-E curve in the first and third quadrants exhibits two distinct, sharp current peaks, a characteristic feature of typical ferroelectric materials. When the doping level increases from 0.01 to 0.02, a notable change is observed in the current peaks: a distinct shoulder emerges near the main peak, indicating that the locally polar nanoregions (PNRs) have significantly influenced the macroscopic ferroelectricity. From an energy perspective, despite the high dynamism of PNRs that revert to a disordered state upon the removal of the electric field , the contribution to E c during periodic ferroelectric testing comprises two facets. According to , with increasing Nd doping, XRD results indicate that the phase structure of yNd: BS-0.64PT ceramics evolves towards a tetragonal symmetry. In this work, the phase structure of yNd: BS-0.64PT ceramics shown in the XRD patterns is identified as a mixture of rhombohedral and tetragonal phases. PNRs with tetragonal symmetry are weakly polar phases, typically susceptible to external field disturbances. In reality, NdScO3 possesses orthorhombic symmetry and exhibits strong polarity. Therefore, the switching of PNRs introduced by Nd doping requires a higher electric field disturbance. As a result, the reduction in E c is not pronounced when y increases from 0.01 to 0.02. For y = 0.03, an increased amount of Nd leads to a decrease in long-range domains and the generation of more PNRs. Simultaneously, the decrease in T m , as shown in (f), means highly dynamic PNRs. The electric field required for the reorientation of PNRs will also shift towards a lower electric field. Further increasing Nd to y = 0.04 results in more PNRs, causing a sharp decrease in P max and P r. The reduction in E c is more moderate, as the switching field of PNRs aligns with the field required for the alignment of long-range ferroelectric domains.

# INTRODUCTION
Since the discovery of the piezoelectric effect by the Curies in 1880, piezoelectric materials have emerged as pivotal components in a diverse range of energy conversion applications. To date, PZT-based piezoelectric ceramics, with their ability for chemical modification to cater to varied performance demands, remain dominant in the realm of piezoelectric materials\u2014a choice made by history. However, in demanding harsh environments such as deep petroleum exploration with high temperatures, the application of PZT meets challenges due to its maximum operating temperature being below 250 \xb0C. The discovery of BS-PT system with a high curie temperature in 2001 provided a new possibility for addressing this challenge. Based on the empirical correlationship between tolerance factor and Curie temperature in perovskite crystal structures, Eitel et al. have engineered the BS-xPT system with a high Curie temperate (450 \xb0C) and piezoelectric coefficient (460 pC/N). The exceptional performance of BS-xPT has garnered widespread attention since its inception, holding promise for significant contributions in the field of high-temperature piezoelectric applications. Analogous to PZT, this system demonstrates a morphotropic phase boundary (MPB), located at x = 0.64. Therefore, methods employed to enhance the performance of PZT should similarly be applicable to the BS-PT system, such as element doping, solid-solution modification, and improved preparation methods. Nevertheless, the reality for the BS-PT system proves to be more intricate than initially anticipated. Despite over two decades of development, there is a scarcity of studies that have achieved a notable enhancement in the piezoelectric coefficient d 33 , surpassing the threshold of 600 pC/N. Among these, drawing inspiration from enhancing performance related to single crystal anisotropy, the template grain growth (TGG) method has gained prominence in recent years in the field of piezoelectric ceramics. TGG is employed to selectively cultivate crystallographic orientation in polycrystalline ceramics, effectively improving performance and achieving levels comparable to those of single crystals. For instance, Wang et al. achieved a high electromechanical coupling coefficient (k 33 ) of 81.2 % and a d 33 value of 612 pC/N in <001>-oriented 0.43BS-0.57PT textured ceramics. Lee et al. reported an exceptionally high d 33 of 719 pC/N in textured ceramics with a composition of Sm-doped 0.38BS-0.62PT. Additionally, Ren et al. demonstrated a d 33 value of 613 pC/N through the texturing of 0.40BS-0.60PT ceramics. These findings underscore the effectiveness of texturing techniques in enhancing the piezoelectric performance of the BS-PT system. However, these reports, utilizing a textured matrix with lower PT content, have led to a reduction in T c. Particularly noteworthy are the breakthroughs in piezoelectric performance achieved through rare earth element doping in PMN-PT single crystals and ceramics. For the BS-PT system, there is also a wealth of research related to doping modification. In 2004, Eitel et al. found that La doping had a very limited impact on the piezoelectric performance of the BS-PT system. Li et al. found that increasing the Y content in (Bi1-y Y y )ScO3-xPbTiO3 reduces the d 33 but elevates the T c. Alp et al. discovered that Zr doping can elevate the room temperature piezoelectric performance of BS-0.63PT from 335 pC/N to 430 pC/N, but this enhancement is not observed at high temperatures. Dai et al. utilized 1 mol% Zr doping to increase the d 33 of BS-0.64PT from 402 pC/N to 476 pC/N. There have been no reports on the study of the influence of Nd doping on the BS-PT system. Therefore, this paper comprehensively investigates the impact of Nd on the BS-PT system, including phase structure, microstructure, and electrical properties.

# CONCLUSION
Nd-doped BS-PT ceramics were prepared, and a comprehensive investigation was conducted to assess the impact of Nd and PT content on the microstructure and electrical properties of BS-PT ceramics. Nd incorporation proves to be effective in enhancing the piezoelectric performance of BS-xPT ceramics, reaching its peak at x = 0.64. For yNd: BS-0.64PT ceramics, an increment in Nd content leads to a shift in the phase structure towards the tetragonal phase, enhancing dielectric properties and increasing relaxation behavior while weakening ferroelectric performance. The optimal d 33 is attained at y = 0.02, reaching a maximum value of 550 pC/N. We believe that this enhancement enables Nd-doped BS-PT ceramic to exhibit superior performance in a wide range of applications, particularly in sensors and actuators.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
To examine the influence of Nd doping as well as PT content on the piezoelectric performance of BS-PT ceramics, 0.02Nd: BS-xPT (x = 0.62, 0.63, 0.64, and 0.65) ceramics were fabricated. (a) illustrates the XRD patterns for 0.02Nd: BS-xPT as a function of PT content. This observation implies the complete incorporation of NdE^{3+} into the crystal lattices of BS-PT. Utilizing the differences in characteristic splitting between rhombohedral and tetragonal phases, the pseudo-cubic (200) diffraction peak serves as a preliminary indicator for the evolution of phase structures. The XRD profiles in (a) reveal that the average symmetry of the examined compositions (x = 0.62, 0.63, 0.64, 0.65, and 0.66) evolves from rhombohedral to tetragonal with increasing PT content. The MPB in 0.02Nd: BS-xPT is observed to be around x = 0.64, consistent with that in the literature. (b) illustrates the changes in d 33 and k p for 0.02Nd: BS-xPT ceramics with respect to PT content. Remarkably, d 33 exhibits an initial increase followed by a decrease with the rise in PT content, reaching its peak value of 550 pC/N at x = 0.64, whereas k p shows minimal variation, maintaining a level around 0.5. Although the variation in k p is relatively modest, the overall trend demonstrates an initial increase followed by a decrease as PT content varies, featuring the typical enhancement of electromechanical properties near the MPB. The maximum k p is observed at x = 0.65, in contrast to the maximum d 33 , which occurs at x = 0.64. The peak values of the coupling factor and piezoelectric constant occur at different compositions, within approximately 1 % mol. Similar studies have been reported in Nb-doped PSN-PT and Sm-doped PMN-PT systems. Upon comparison with the undoped BS-xPT ceramics reported in the literatures , it is evident that Nd doping significantly enhances the piezoelectric properties of BS-xPT ceramics. This enhancement in electrical properties observed in 0.02Nd-doped BS-xPT may primarily result from the local structural heterogeneity induced by Nd doping, leading to a smoothing of the thermodynamic energy profile. In (a), the temperature-dependent dielectric constant (\u03b5 r ) of 0.02Nd: BS-xPT samples is depicted for various PT contents. Additionally, (b) illustrates the changes in the room temperature dielectric constant (\u03b5 r ), the temperature associated with the maximum dielectric constant (T m ), and the temperature variation (\u0394T m ) for 0.02Nd: BS-xPT ceramics with varying PT contents. The \u03b5 r of 0.02Nd: BS-xPT ceramics experience a slight decrease with the rise in PT content, whereas T m increases. In conjunction with the phase structure evolution depicted in (a), the increase in PT content corresponds to a transformation of the phase structure towards the tetragonal phase. Thus, the increased T m is attributed to the elevated Curie temperature (490 \xb0C) of tetragonal PT. Through a comparable doping level (0.02Nd), an increased PT content stabilizes the tetragonal phase while diminishing the extent of structural heterogeneity. The parameter \u0394T m , defined as the disparity between T m values measured at 1 kHz and 1 MHz, is employed to evaluate the relaxation behavior. It exhibits a declining trend with the increase in PT content, providing evidence for diminishing structural heterogeneity. The P-E hysteresis loops and the variation of characteristic parameters of 0.02Nd: BS-xPT with different PT content are recorded at 1 Hz and depicted in (c) and (d). All compositions display well-saturated loops, signifying the robust ferroelectric properties of 0.02Nd: BS-xPT ceramics. The variations in saturation polarization (P max ) and remnant polarization (P r ) exhibit a congruent trend with the increasing PT content, characterized by an initial augmentation followed by a subsequent decline. The pinnacle of P max and P r , as well as the trough of E c , are identified at x = 0.64. As a result of a more refined alignment of spontaneous polarization at MPB, the ceramics exhibit an augmented remnant polarization. This enhancement further facilitates the poling process, as demonstrated by the PT-dependent behaviors of d 33 and k p , as illustrated in (b). Nd doping proves highly effective in elevating the electrical performance of 0.02Nd: BS-xPT ceramics, reaching its zenith at x = 0.64. Our investigation delves deeper into the impact of Nd content on the phase structure, microscopic structure, and electrical properties of yNd: BS-0.64PT ceramics. The XRD patterns of yNd: BS-0.64PT ceramics at room temperature are presented in (a). The distinctive diffraction lines of pure perovskite reveal the successful incorporation of varied concentrations of NdE^{3+} into the lattice of BS-64PT. Upon closer examination of the magnified (002) diffraction profile in (a), a subtle shift towards higher angles is discernible in the (002) diffraction peak. This is due to the ionic radius falling within the range between BiE^{3+} (1.03 \xc5) and ScE^{3+} (0.75 \xc5), prompting NdE^{3+} (0.983 \xc5) to preferentially substitute for BiE^{3+} at the A-site. This induces volume contraction, consequently diminishing the interplanar spacing, providing evidence that NdE^{3+} indeed incorporates into the lattice. The extent of splitting in the (002) diffraction peak was assessed by employing Gaussian-Lorentz fitting, facilitating the discernment of individual phases near the MPB, as shown in (b)-(e). Given that all samples exhibit the characteristics of two-phase coexistence, the diffraction peak observed near 45\xb0 results from the superposition of characteristic peaks corresponding to the tetragonal and rhombohedral phases. Namely, the (002)T and (200)T corresponding to the tetragonal phase, while the (200)R peak is associated with the rhombohedral phase. The phase fractions in ceramics with varying Nd content can be determined using the following equations : where I (002) T and I (200) T represent the intensity of the two diffraction peaks corresponding to the T phase, respectively, while I (200) R refers to the intensity of the diffraction peak corresponding to the R phase. The fitting results reveal a continual rise in the proportion of the tetragonal phase with the increasing content of Nd, as concluded in (f). (a\u2013d) depicts the fracture surface microstructure of yNd: BS-0.64PT ceramics. The grain size distribution determined using Nano Measurer software corresponded with the Gaussian distribution function, as shown in (e\u2013h). The ceramics with a composition of yNd: BS-0.64PT demonstrated nuanced variations in average grain sizes: 2.67 \u03bcm (y = 0.01), 2.55 \u03bcm (y = 0.02), 2.91 \u03bcm (y = 0.03), and 3.29 \u03bcm (y = 0.04). With an escalation in Nd content, there is a concurrent reduction in sintering temperature, thereby, under identical sintering conditions, resulting in the enlargement of grain size. (e\u2013h) present the bulk density data of yNd: BS-0.64PT ceramics, using the Archimedes principle. It can be observed that the sample with y = 0.02 exhibits the highest value. The achievement of the most densely packed microstructure is associated with the optimal substitution level of Nd ions with y = 0.02. (a\u2013d) presents an examination of the dielectric response in yNd: BS-0.64PT ceramics, showcasing their temperature dependence across various frequencies. In samples featuring diverse Nd doping levels, a conspicuous frequency dispersion below T m (the temperature corresponding to the maximum dielectric constant) signifies the presence of relaxor characteristics attributed to PNRs. The extent of diffusive phase transitions can be quantitatively examined by fitting ln(1/\u03b5 r -1/\u03b5 m ) against ln(T-T m ) according to illustrated in the insets of (a\u2013d). where \u03b3 represents the slope of the fitting curves, \u03b5 T signifies the dielectric permittivity at different temperatures, T denotes the measure temperature, \u03b5 m indicates the maximum value of \u03b5 T , T m (@1 kHz) is the temperature at which it occurs, and C stands for the Curie Weiss constant. And \u03b3 varies between 1 and 2 for the normal ferroelectrics and ideal relaxor ferroelectrics, respectively. As the Nd content increases, there is a gradual rise in the \u03b3 value, suggesting an intensified diffusive phase transition. Nevertheless, it should be emphasized that diffusive phase transitions are characteristics of relaxors, with frequency dispersion being their fundamental nature, which can be relatively quantified through \u0394T m (the difference between T m at 1 kHz and 1 MHz). (f) visually depicts the variation of \u0394T m , room temperature dielectric constant (\u03b5 r ), and T m with changing Nd content. As the Nd content increases, there is a steady rise in \u0394T m , indicating an intensified frequency dispersion of the dielectric constant in yNd: BS-0.64PT ceramics. The introduction of NdE^{3+} ions into BS-0.64PT ceramics contributes to a more pronounced compositional disorder, leading to chemical inhomogeneity and the subsequent emergence of PNRs. The dielectric constant \u03b5 r exhibits a continuous rise as the Nd content increases. The heterogenous PNRs induced by Nd doping introduce additional interfacial energy in the system, thereby flattening the average free energy curve and consequently enhancing the dielectric properties. This enhancement comes with a trade-off of a lowered T m , attributed to the disruption of the long-range order by the introduction of Nd. (a) elucidates the changes in piezoelectric coefficients in yNd: BS-0.64PT ceramics as a function of Nd content. The ceramic with 0.02Nd doping in BS-0.64PT demonstrates a maximum d 33 value of 550 pC/N, significantly surpassing the corresponding value for undoped BS-0.64PT ceramics. The piezoelectric voltage coefficient g 33 exhibits a maximum value at y = 0.02, reaching 39.8 (\xd710E^{\u22123} V m/N), which is significantly higher than that of commercial PZT-5A ceramics (24.8\xd710E^{\u22123} V m/N) and even slightly exceeds that observed in PMN-0.30PT single crystal (34.2\xd710E^{\u22123} V m/N) , demonstrating excellent sensitive capabilities. offers a detailed comparison of d 33 and T m values of 0.02Nd: BS-PT ceramics with other BS-PT-based and commercial PZT ceramics. It can be seen that the enhancement in piezoelectric properties of these modified BS-PT ceramics appears to be limited, with certain modifications even resulting in performance degradation. This could be intricately linked to the optimal densification of the microstructure, variations in phase components near the MPB in yNd: BS-0.64PT ceramics, and the induced local structural heterogeneity resulting from Nd doping. The ferroelectric characteristics of yNd: BS-0.64PT ceramics with different Nd concentrations were examined under room temperature conditions. The unipolar strain curves under 4 kV/mm at 1 Hz were shown in (b). The maximum strain at is 0.248 % at y = 0.02, and its corresponding effective piezoelectric coefficient d 33 * (the ratio of the maximum strain and the maximum electric field) is as high as 620 pm/V. The value of d 33 * is larger than that of d 33 , which was also observed in many lead-based piezoceramics. This is due to the fact that the electric-field-induced strain not only from the piezoelectric effect but also domain switching. (c) presents the stain curves under different electric fields of 2, 3, and 4 kV/mm, along with the corresponding maximum stain values. A comparison with commercials PZT ceramics, undoped BS-64PT, and PMN-PT ceramics shows that 0.02Nd: BS-PT ceramic exhibits superior stain response. (d) and (e) depict a comprehensive comparison of P-E and I-E curves, while (f) illustrates the variations in P max , P r , and E c at various Nd content. Combining with I-E curves, with a specific focus on the evolution of current peaks (providing insights into the internal domain switching), allows for the extraction of valuable information regarding the material\u2019s internal microstructural evolution at the domain structure level, induced by the introduction of Nd. Notably, compositions y = 0.02 and y = 0.03 display a characteristic of splitting, with a shoulder adjacent to the main peak. This feature is more pronounced at y = 0.02. Conversely, components y = 0.01 and y = 0.04 present a singular current peak. For y = 0.01, the I-E curve in the first and third quadrants exhibits two distinct, sharp current peaks, a characteristic feature of typical ferroelectric materials. When the doping level increases from 0.01 to 0.02, a notable change is observed in the current peaks: a distinct shoulder emerges near the main peak, indicating that the locally polar nanoregions (PNRs) have significantly influenced the macroscopic ferroelectricity. From an energy perspective, despite the high dynamism of PNRs that revert to a disordered state upon the removal of the electric field , the contribution to E c during periodic ferroelectric testing comprises two facets. According to , with increasing Nd doping, XRD results indicate that the phase structure of yNd: BS-0.64PT ceramics evolves towards a tetragonal symmetry. In this work, the phase structure of yNd: BS-0.64PT ceramics shown in the XRD patterns is identified as a mixture of rhombohedral and tetragonal phases. PNRs with tetragonal symmetry are weakly polar phases, typically susceptible to external field disturbances. In reality, NdScO3 possesses orthorhombic symmetry and exhibits strong polarity. Therefore, the switching of PNRs introduced by Nd doping requires a higher electric field disturbance. As a result, the reduction in E c is not pronounced when y increases from 0.01 to 0.02. For y = 0.03, an increased amount of Nd leads to a decrease in long-range domains and the generation of more PNRs. Simultaneously, the decrease in T m , as shown in (f), means highly dynamic PNRs. The electric field required for the reorientation of PNRs will also shift towards a lower electric field. Further increasing Nd to y = 0.04 results in more PNRs, causing a sharp decrease in P max and P r. The reduction in E c is more moderate, as the switching field of PNRs aligns with the field required for the alignment of long-range ferroelectric domains.

# INTRODUCTION
Since the discovery of the piezoelectric effect by the Curies in 1880, piezoelectric materials have emerged as pivotal components in a diverse range of energy conversion applications. To date, PZT-based piezoelectric ceramics, with their ability for chemical modification to cater to varied performance demands, remain dominant in the realm of piezoelectric materials\u2014a choice made by history. However, in demanding harsh environments such as deep petroleum exploration with high temperatures, the application of PZT meets challenges due to its maximum operating temperature being below 250 \xb0C. The discovery of BS-PT system with a high curie temperature in 2001 provided a new possibility for addressing this challenge. Based on the empirical correlationship between tolerance factor and Curie temperature in perovskite crystal structures, Eitel et al. have engineered the BS-xPT system with a high Curie temperate (450 \xb0C) and piezoelectric coefficient (460 pC/N). The exceptional performance of BS-xPT has garnered widespread attention since its inception, holding promise for significant contributions in the field of high-temperature piezoelectric applications. Analogous to PZT, this system demonstrates a morphotropic phase boundary (MPB), located at x = 0.64. Therefore, methods employed to enhance the performance of PZT should similarly be applicable to the BS-PT system, such as element doping, solid-solution modification, and improved preparation methods. Nevertheless, the reality for the BS-PT system proves to be more intricate than initially anticipated. Despite over two decades of development, there is a scarcity of studies that have achieved a notable enhancement in the piezoelectric coefficient d 33 , surpassing the threshold of 600 pC/N. Among these, drawing inspiration from enhancing performance related to single crystal anisotropy, the template grain growth (TGG) method has gained prominence in recent years in the field of piezoelectric ceramics. TGG is employed to selectively cultivate crystallographic orientation in polycrystalline ceramics, effectively improving performance and achieving levels comparable to those of single crystals. For instance, Wang et al. achieved a high electromechanical coupling coefficient (k 33 ) of 81.2 % and a d 33 value of 612 pC/N in <001>-oriented 0.43BS-0.57PT textured ceramics. Lee et al. reported an exceptionally high d 33 of 719 pC/N in textured ceramics with a composition of Sm-doped 0.38BS-0.62PT. Additionally, Ren et al. demonstrated a d 33 value of 613 pC/N through the texturing of 0.40BS-0.60PT ceramics. These findings underscore the effectiveness of texturing techniques in enhancing the piezoelectric performance of the BS-PT system. However, these reports, utilizing a textured matrix with lower PT content, have led to a reduction in T c. Particularly noteworthy are the breakthroughs in piezoelectric performance achieved through rare earth element doping in PMN-PT single crystals and ceramics. For the BS-PT system, there is also a wealth of research related to doping modification. In 2004, Eitel et al. found that La doping had a very limited impact on the piezoelectric performance of the BS-PT system. Li et al. found that increasing the Y content in (Bi1-y Y y )ScO3-xPbTiO3 reduces the d 33 but elevates the T c. Alp et al. discovered that Zr doping can elevate the room temperature piezoelectric performance of BS-0.63PT from 335 pC/N to 430 pC/N, but this enhancement is not observed at high temperatures. Dai et al. utilized 1 mol% Zr doping to increase the d 33 of BS-0.64PT from 402 pC/N to 476 pC/N. There have been no reports on the study of the influence of Nd doping on the BS-PT system. Therefore, this paper comprehensively investigates the impact of Nd on the BS-PT system, including phase structure, microstructure, and electrical properties.

# CONCLUSION
Nd-doped BS-PT ceramics were prepared, and a comprehensive investigation was conducted to assess the impact of Nd and PT content on the microstructure and electrical properties of BS-PT ceramics. Nd incorporation proves to be effective in enhancing the piezoelectric performance of BS-xPT ceramics, reaching its peak at x = 0.64. For yNd: BS-0.64PT ceramics, an increment in Nd content leads to a shift in the phase structure towards the tetragonal phase, enhancing dielectric properties and increasing relaxation behavior while weakening ferroelectric performance. The optimal d 33 is attained at y = 0.02, reaching a maximum value of 550 pC/N. We believe that this enhancement enables Nd-doped BS-PT ceramic to exhibit superior performance in a wide range of applications, particularly in sensors and actuators.
