# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
displays the XRD patterns of xPSN-(1 \u2212 x \u2212 y)PMN-yPT ceramics. Each sample is of pure perovskite structure without pyrochlore phase, which implies that PSN and PMN-PT have successfully formed a solid solution. For PT-based ferroelectric systems, the change of the phase structure can generally be reflected through the diffraction peak of (200) around 45\xb0. (b), (d), (f) and (h) depict the evolution of (200) diffraction peak with the variable composition. It is evident that with the increasing PT content, the same variation trend of the (200) peak is observed for PSN-PMN-PT samples with different x (x = 0.06, 0.15, 0.29, and 0.43). Taking the x = 0.15 ceramics as an example, when the PT content is less than 0.35 mol (y < 0.35), the (200) diffraction peak is single and the crystalline structure of these compositions is dominated by rhombohedral phase. As y increases to 0.35, the (200) peak starts to broaden, indicating that the phase transition begins in this component. When y further increases, a shoulder on the left side of the (200) peak occurs and its relative intensity gradually increases. As y rises to 0.40, the (200) peak almost splits into (200) and (002), suggesting that the tetragonal phase is dominant. For PT-based ferroelectric ceramics, grain size is one of the key factors affecting their electric properties, because the grain size determines the domain size, which is closely related to electric properties. As an example, presents the surface SEM images of the 0.15PSN-(0.85 \u2212 y)PMN-yPT, and illustrate the corresponding grain size distribution. The bulk density of these ceramics varies between 7.5 and 7.85 g/cmE^{3}, and the relative densities are greater than 95 %. According to the grain size distribution in , it has been observed that the mean grain size for all 0.15PSN-(0.85 \u2212 y)PMN-yPT ceramics varies within a small range of 1.9 \u2212 2.38 \u03bcm, indicating the influence of grain size on the electric performances of x = 0.15 ceramics with different PT content can be ignored. This conclusion also applies to x = 0.06, 0.29, and 0.43 ceramics with different PT content in this study. To further determine the composition-induced phase transition behaviors of the PSN-PMN-PT ceramics, the fitting of the XRD patterns of x = 0.15 ceramics were fitted using the Rietveld refinement , the refined results are presented in and. The optimal Rietveld refinement results are achieved for all x = 0.15 ceramics by using the following phase models: R3m + Pm (R + MC) for y = 0.32 \u2212 0.33, R3m + Pm + Cm (R + Mc + MA) for y = 0.34, and P4mm + Pm (T + MC) for y = 0.35 \u2212 0.40, demonstrating that multi-phases with competing symmetries coexist in the PSN-PMN-PT system. The detailed phase volume fractions of all x = 0.15 ceramics based on the refined results is exhibited in. Clearly, in the ceramics with y = 0.32 and 0.33, the R and MC phases coexist and MC phase is dominant, and the MC phase fraction is 72 % and 89 %, respectively. For y = 0.34 ceramic, the three-phase coexistence of MC, MA and R is observed, with volume fractions of 84 %, 6 % and 10 %, respectively. When the y exceeds 0.34, R and MA phases disappear, and the samples show the two-phase coexistence of MC and T. Moreover, as the y rises from 0.35 to 0.40, the T phase fraction progressively increased from 20 % to 70 % and the MC phase fraction decreased from 80 % to 30 %. The results of the phase fraction for x = 0.15 ceramics are consistent with the analysis in (b) and are also in agreement with the phase diagram. Previous studies have confirmed that the 0.43PSN-0.17PMN-0.40PT ceramic consists of a combination of MC (21.19 %) and T (78.81 %) phases and T phase is dominant, implying that similar trend of phase fraction with increased PT content should be obtained in x = 0.06, 0.29 and 0.43 components. The multi-phases coexistence is an intrinsic feature in PSN-PMN-PT system, which is in good agreement with the observations in other PT-based ferroelectrics. The variations of the dielectric permittivity \u03b5 r and dielectric loss factor tan\u03b4 for poled xPSN-(1 \u2212 x \u2212 y)PMN-yPT ceramics with temperature in the range of 30 \u2013 300 \xb0C are illustrated in (a)-(d). All measurements of the curves are measured at a frequency of 1 kHz. As can be observed, for x = 0.06, 0.15, 0.29 and 0.43 ceramics with low PT content, the presence of two distinct dielectric anomalous peaks is observed, corresponding to the phase transition of ferroelectric-ferroelectric (F-F) and ferroelectric-paraelectric (F-P), respectively. With the increasing PT content, the dielectric anomalous peak associated with F-F phase transition (at low temperature T f-f) gradually weakens and only a single dielectric anomalous peak connected with F-P phase transition (at high temperature T c) is obviously observed. The visual phase transition temperatures T f-f and T c for all xPSN-(1 \u2013 x \u2212 y)PMN-yPT samples are depicted in (e). In all ceramics with the same x, the T f-f decreases while T c increases with increasing PT content, which can be ascribed to gradually increased tetragonal phase fraction, since the PT is of tetragonal phase as well as a high T c of 490 \xb0C. Besides, the observation indicates that, for the ceramics with the same PT content, the PSN-PMN-PT system exhibits an increase in both T f-f and T c as the PSN content increases, which results from the larger rhombohedral lattice deformation and higher T c of PSN in comparison with PMN. It should be noted that the tan\u03b4 of all ceramics is less than 0.05 in the whole test temperature range. Additionally, as the PT content increases, the dielectric anomaly peak connected with F-P phase transition in x = 0.06, 0.15, 0.29 and 0.43 ceramics gradually become narrow, indicating the relaxation behavior gradually weakens. Such dielectric relaxor behavior can be demonstrated by the modified Curie-Weiss law of 1/\u025b \u2212 1/\u025b max = (T \u2212 T max)E^{ }/C, where C represents the Curie-Weiss constant, and \u03b3 represents the diffusion coefficient, and \u025b max and T max refer to the maximum dielectric constant and the corresponding temperature, respectively. The fitting results of the representative 0.15PSN-(0.85 \u2212 y)PMN-yPT ceramics are as depicted in (f). The calculated \u03b3 value decreases from 1.79 for y = 0.32 to 1.58 for y = 0.40 ceramics, which can be put down to the reason that PT is a classical ferroelectric. In the meantime, the high \u03b3 signifies the strong relaxor characteristics of the PSN-PMN-PT system, which can be attributed to the intensified ionic disorder and local charge mismatch at B site. (a) shows the variation trend of relative permittivity \u03b5 r of all components. As the PT content increases, the trend of \u03b5 r can be observed to exhibit an initial increase followed by a subsequent decrease in each special x. The maximum value is obtained near y = 0.35, 0.38, 0.39 and 0.41, respectively, for x = 0.06, 0.15, 0.29 and 0.43 ceramics. In combination with XRD analysis, these samples have the two-phase coexistence of T + MC and the T phase is dominant. The polarization-electric field (P \u2212 E) loops of xPSN-(1 \u2212 x \u2212 y)PMN-yPT samples under a 20 kV/cm electric field are depicted in. The presence of well-shaped hysteresis loops with saturation in all samples clearly indicates their well ferroelectricity. (b) displays the remanent polarization P r and coercive electric field E c of the xPSN-(1 \u2212 x \u2212 y)PMN-yPT ceramics. As y increases for each x, it is evident that the values of P r slightly fluctuate around 30 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}, while the E c values gradually increase due to the increase of T phase fraction. For piezoelectric materials, piezoelectric coefficient (d 33) is commonly regarded as a crucial parameter that signifies the capacity to transform external force into charge. In general, the d 33 exhibits a direct correlation with the ferroelectric polarization and dielectric characteristics of piezoelectric ceramics. The equation of d 33\u221d \u03b5 r P r can be used to establish the relationships among them. (c) and (d) present the \u025b r P r and d 33 of xPSN-(1 \u2212 x \u2212 y)PMN-yPT ceramics. It is evident that as PT content increases, both d 33 and \u025b r P r exhibit a similar tendency of initial increase followed by decrease, suggesting the improvement of d 33 is indeed resulted from the enhanced \u025b r P r. The maximum d 33 value for each x occurs at 0.06PSN-0.59PMN-0.35PT, 0.15PSN-0.48PMN-0.37PT, 0.29PSN-0.32PMN-0.39PT and 0.43PSN-0.17PMN-0.40PT samples and the corresponding value is 665, 620, 585, and 650 pC/N, respectively. It should be pointed out that the high d 33 for these ceramics mainly originates from enhanced \u025b r instead of P r, since the P r only presents a slight change. Combining the Rietveld refinement results of x = 0.15, it can be inferred that the high d 33 obtained at y = 0.36, 0.37 mainly results from the easy polarization rotation induced by external electric field owing to the appropriate phase fraction of T + MC. As the PT content is further increased, d 33 shows a marked decrease. Combining the refinement results, the decrease of d 33 can be attributed to the further increasing fraction of the tetragonal phase proportion, because the domain switching gets harder. Moreover, as the x increases, the component with the highest d 33 shifts to the region with higher PT content, which is due to the larger rhombohedral lattice deformation of PSN. The k p shows a similar trend to that of d 33, which exhibits an initial increase followed by a subsequent decrease as the y increases, and the k p value can reach up to 0.67, as depicted in. lists the detailed d 33 and k p values for each ceramic. The piezoelectric performances of piezoceramics are subject to temperature variation due to the thermal depolarization. presents the temperature-dependent pyroelectric current density for the poled 0.06PSN-0.59PMN-0.35PT, 0.15PSN-0.48PMN-0.37PT, 0.29PSN-0.32PMN-0.39PT and 0.43PSN-0.17PMN-0.40PT ceramics. We can obviously see that each sample exhibits two current density peaks and the corresponding temperatures are 70 \xb0C and 181 \xb0C for 0.06PSN-0.59PMN-0.35PT, 75 \xb0C and 200 \xb0C for 0.15PSN-0.48PMN-0.37PT, 75 \xb0C and 226 \xb0C for 0.29PSN-0.32PMN-0.39PT, 68 \xb0C and 248 \xb0C for 0.43PSN-0.17PMN-0.40PT samples. These temperatures are almost in agreement with their T f-f and T c obtained from \u025b r \u2212 T curves. Obviously, the current peak connected with F-F transition for each ceramic is flatter, signifying the good polarization stability. (a) and (b) present the temperature dependence of in-situ k 33 T/k 33 RT and d 33 T/d 33 RT for the poled 0.06PSN-0.59PMN-0.35PT, 0.15PSN-0.48PMN-0.37PT, 0.29PSN-0.32PMN-0.39PT and 0.43PSN-0.17PMN-0.40PT samples. The k 33 T/k 33 RT values of all ceramics display a trend of monotone decrease as the temperature increases. The k 33 T/k 33 RT values of all samples reduce by within 10 % in the test temperature range from 30 to 100 \xb0C. When the test temperature increases to around T c of each ceramic, the k 33 T/k 33 RT only decreases 29 %, 24 %, 15 %, and 24 % for 0.06PSN-0.59PMN-0.35PT, 0.15PSN-0.48PMN-0.37PT, 0.29PSN-0.32PMN-0.39PT and 0.43PSN-0.17PMN-0.40PT ceramics, respectively, demonstrating the k 33 possesses good temperature stability. The in-suit d 33 is calculated by the formula : d = k *(\u03b5 T s E) /E^{33}E^{33}E^{33}E^{33}E^{1}E^{2}, where \u03b5 33 T is the free dielectric constant, s 33 E refers to the elastic compliance coefficient. The temperature dependence of \u03b5 33 T and s 33 E results of xPSN-(1 \u2013 x \u2212 y)PMN-yPT ceramics are depicted in. As presented in (b), as the temperature increases, the variation trend of d 33 T/d 33 RT for each component is similar, showing an increase first and then a decrease near T f-f and T c. The temperature at which the d 33 value suddenly drops commonly refers to the depolarization temperature (T d). The T d values of the ceramic samples are 170 \xb0C (x / y = 0.06 / 0.35), 190 \xb0C (x / y = 0.15 / 0.37), 200 \xb0C (x = / y = 0.29 / 0.39) and 230 \xb0C (x / y = 0.43 / 0.40). From room temperature to the T d of each ceramic, the variation rate of d 33 is 13 %, 7 %, 5 % and 15 % for 0.06PSN-0.59PMN-0.35PT, 0.15PSN-0.48PMN-0.37PT, 0.29PSN-0.32PMN-0.39PT and 0.43PSN-0.17PMN-0.40PT ceramics, respectively. The results mentioned above mean that the PSN-PMN-PT ceramics exhibit a good thermal stability. In order to evaluate the potential of PSN-PMN-PT ceramics in ultrasonic transducers, the 0.06PSN-0.59PMN-0.35PT sample with the highest d 33 of 665 pC/N is chosen as an active element of ultrasonic transducer. (b) and (c) displays the simulated and tested pulse-echo responses and Fourier spectra for the fabricated PSN-PMN-PT transducer, respectively. It can be seen that the measured f c and \u22126 dB bandwidth are 4.65 MHz and 77.4 %, respectively, which agree well with the simulated results (f c \u223c 4.69 MHz and BW \u223c 80.3 %). The \u22126 dB bandwidth of the PSN-PMN-PT transducer surpasses that of other transducers reported in the literature with the similar center frequency , as shown in (d). The IL of the transducer measured at f c is \u221221.45 dB, which is better than the transducer fabricated using PMN-PT single crystal (IL \u223c \u221228.7 dB). According to the obtained data, it can be concluded that PSN-PMN-PT ceramics exhibit great potential for ultrasonic transducer applications.

# TITLE
Phase structure and electrical properties of ternary PSN-PMN-PT ceramics and their applications in ultrasonic transducers

# ABSTRACT
In this work, a series of xPSN-(1 − x − y)PMN-yPT (x = 0.06 − 0.43, y = 0.32 − 0.42) ternary ceramics with different phase structures were synthesized by the solid state reaction method, and the specific phase structure, electrical properties and thermal stability as a function of compositions were investigated. It is found that with the increasing PT content, the phase transition sequence is MC + R → MC + MA + R →MC + T for the ceramics with the same PSN content. Meanwhile, with the increasing PSN content, the MPB compositions shift to higher PT content. The maximum d

                     33 is 13 %, 7 %, 5 %, and 15 %, respectively, demonstrating that these ceramics have a good thermal stability. In addition, the 0.06PSN-0.59PMN-0.35PT ceramic with the highest d
                     33 is selected as an active element of ultrasonic transducer, and the ultrasonic transducer with a center frequency of 4.65 MHz was produced. The −6 dB bandwidth and two-way insertion loss are 77.4 % and −21.45 dB, respectively. This work has important implications for the further development of high-performance PT based ferroelectrics.

# INTRODUCTION
Constructing materials with morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) compositions is a simple and practical method to effectively improve the piezoelectric response of ferroelectric ceramics, and it has been widely used in both lead-free and lead-based systems. Among them, the representative Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-PbTiO3 (PMN-PT) relaxor ferroelectrics with MPB compositions have been widely studied because of their extremely high electromechanical coupling coefficient (k 33 > 0.65) and piezoelectric constant (d 33 > 600 pC/N). However, the low phase transition temperature T r-t (60 \u2212 90 \xb0C) and Curie temperature T c (130 \u2212 160 \xb0C) restrict their application in high-temperature environments. For the development of new relaxor ferroelectrics with high T c and T r-t, the researchers introduced end elements with high T c into PMN-PT, obtaining many new ternary systems with rising T c (T c \u2265 200 \xb0C) and T r-t (T r-t \u2265 100 \xb0C), such as Pb(Yb1/2Nb1/2)O3-Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-PbTiO3 (PYN-PMN-PT) , Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3- PbZrO3-PbTiO3 (PMN-PZ-PT) , Pb(In1/2Nb1/2)O3-Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-PbTiO3 (PIN-PMN-PT) , etc. Moreover, in comparison to PMN-PT systems, the T c and d 33 values of the ternary system can be regulated over a wider range, which is advantageous for users to select various components to satisfy the requirements of various applications. For instance, by adjusting the composition, the T c of PYN-PMN-PT can vary between 165 and 370 \xb0C, and the d 33 can vary between 373 and 505 pC/N. For PMN-PT based materials, the selection of end elements has a great influence on the performance. Among all relaxor ferroelectric, Pb(Sc1/2Nb1/2)O3 (PSN) is a typical material with a rhombohedral phase structure and its T c is about 90 \xb0C. The Rhombohedral-Tetragonal MPB of PSN-PT binary system had been successfully constructed near 42 mol% PT, at which high T c, piezoelectric and dielectric properties have been obtained. By combining the MPBs of PMN-PT and PSN-PT, a PSN-PMN-PT ternary system was developed by Yamashita et al. and the d 33 and T c reach 640 pC/N and 205 \xb0C, respectively, in 0.29PSN-0.34PMN-0.37PT composition , which are superior to the PMN-PT system. Recently, the improved thermal stability and piezoelectric performances of PSN-PMN-PT through composition design, ion doping and composite method. As reported by Guo et al., the d 33 and T c of 0.43PSN-0.17PMN-0.40PT composition are 650 pC/N and 255 \xb0C, respectively, in the meantime, the variation rate of d 33 remains below 20 % within a temperature range of 30 \u2013 250 \xb0C. Dong et al. conducted an investigation on 0.15PSN-(0.85 \u2212 x)PMN-xPT ceramics doped with 2 mol% SmE^{3 +}, finding that the d 33 reaches 815 pC/N when x = 0.33, and the d 33 varies by only 8 % over the test temperature range of 30 \u2212 110 \xb0C. Guo et al. noted that the composite ceramic of 0.15PSN-0.51PMN-0.34PT/0.05 mol ZnO exhibits an improved d 33 (590 pC/N) compared to pure 0.15PSN-0.51PMN-0.34PT (d 33 = 529 pC/N), and after annealing at 200 \xb0C, the retained d 33 maintains 92 % of the value before annealing. The results above mentioned show that PSN-PMN-PT system has great potential for practical applications. These questions are essential to comprehend the physical principles underlying the excellent performance of this system, which are very critical for the further development of PSN-PMN-PT solid solution as well as the component design for other ternary systems. In this study, the ternary xPSN-(1 \u2212 x \u2212 y)PMN-yPT (x = 0.06 \u2212 0.43, y = 0.32 \u2212 0.42) ceramics with different phase structures (rhombohedral, tetragonal and monoclinic phases) were established via the linear combination rule, as shown in. The phase structure, electrical properties and thermal stability of PSN-PMN-PT ceramics were analyzed in detail. Furthermore, to evaluate the potential in applications, an ultrasonic transducer with a center frequency (f c) of 4.65 MHz was fabricated using PSN-PMN-PT ceramic as an active element and the \u22126 dB bandwidth (BW) and two-way insertion loss (IL) were measured.

# CONCLUSION
In summary, xPSN-(1 \u2212 x \u2212 y)PMN-yPT (x = 0.06 \u2212 0.43, y = 0.32 \u2212 0.42) ceramics were fabricated with different phase structure. The consequences revealed that as the PT content rises, the ceramics with identical PSN content demonstrate a phase transition sequence of MC + R \u2192 MC + MA + R \u2192 MC + T. Meanwhile, as the PSN content increases, the MPB compositions exhibit a shift toward higher PT content. The maximum d 33 value for each x is obtained at 0.06PSN-0.59PMN-0.35PT, 0.15PSN-0.48PMN-0.37PT, 0.29PSN-0.32PMN-0.39PT and 0.43PSN-0.17PMN-0.40PT ceramics, in which both T and MC phases coexist but the T phase is dominant, and the corresponding value is 665, 620, 585, and 650 pC/N, respectively. The d 33 variation rates of these ceramics, ranging from room temperature to the T d of each ceramic, are 13 %, 7 %, 5 %, and 15 %, respectively, indicating that these ceramics have a good thermal stability. Moreover, the ultrasonic transducer (f c \u223c 4.69 MHz) was prepared using the 0.06PSN-0.59PMN-0.35PT ceramic with the highest d 33 as an active element. The \u22126 dB bandwidth is 77.4 % and two-way insertion loss is \u221221.45 dB. The findings of this study have guiding significance for the advancement of high-performance PT-based ferroelectric ceramics.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
displays the XRD patterns of xPSN-(1 \u2212 x \u2212 y)PMN-yPT ceramics. Each sample is of pure perovskite structure without pyrochlore phase, which implies that PSN and PMN-PT have successfully formed a solid solution. For PT-based ferroelectric systems, the change of the phase structure can generally be reflected through the diffraction peak of (200) around 45\xb0. (b), (d), (f) and (h) depict the evolution of (200) diffraction peak with the variable composition. It is evident that with the increasing PT content, the same variation trend of the (200) peak is observed for PSN-PMN-PT samples with different x (x = 0.06, 0.15, 0.29, and 0.43). Taking the x = 0.15 ceramics as an example, when the PT content is less than 0.35 mol (y < 0.35), the (200) diffraction peak is single and the crystalline structure of these compositions is dominated by rhombohedral phase. As y increases to 0.35, the (200) peak starts to broaden, indicating that the phase transition begins in this component. When y further increases, a shoulder on the left side of the (200) peak occurs and its relative intensity gradually increases. As y rises to 0.40, the (200) peak almost splits into (200) and (002), suggesting that the tetragonal phase is dominant. For PT-based ferroelectric ceramics, grain size is one of the key factors affecting their electric properties, because the grain size determines the domain size, which is closely related to electric properties. As an example, presents the surface SEM images of the 0.15PSN-(0.85 \u2212 y)PMN-yPT, and illustrate the corresponding grain size distribution. The bulk density of these ceramics varies between 7.5 and 7.85 g/cmE^{3}, and the relative densities are greater than 95 %. According to the grain size distribution in , it has been observed that the mean grain size for all 0.15PSN-(0.85 \u2212 y)PMN-yPT ceramics varies within a small range of 1.9 \u2212 2.38 \u03bcm, indicating the influence of grain size on the electric performances of x = 0.15 ceramics with different PT content can be ignored. This conclusion also applies to x = 0.06, 0.29, and 0.43 ceramics with different PT content in this study. To further determine the composition-induced phase transition behaviors of the PSN-PMN-PT ceramics, the fitting of the XRD patterns of x = 0.15 ceramics were fitted using the Rietveld refinement , the refined results are presented in and. The optimal Rietveld refinement results are achieved for all x = 0.15 ceramics by using the following phase models: R3m + Pm (R + MC) for y = 0.32 \u2212 0.33, R3m + Pm + Cm (R + Mc + MA) for y = 0.34, and P4mm + Pm (T + MC) for y = 0.35 \u2212 0.40, demonstrating that multi-phases with competing symmetries coexist in the PSN-PMN-PT system. The detailed phase volume fractions of all x = 0.15 ceramics based on the refined results is exhibited in. Clearly, in the ceramics with y = 0.32 and 0.33, the R and MC phases coexist and MC phase is dominant, and the MC phase fraction is 72 % and 89 %, respectively. For y = 0.34 ceramic, the three-phase coexistence of MC, MA and R is observed, with volume fractions of 84 %, 6 % and 10 %, respectively. When the y exceeds 0.34, R and MA phases disappear, and the samples show the two-phase coexistence of MC and T. Moreover, as the y rises from 0.35 to 0.40, the T phase fraction progressively increased from 20 % to 70 % and the MC phase fraction decreased from 80 % to 30 %. The results of the phase fraction for x = 0.15 ceramics are consistent with the analysis in (b) and are also in agreement with the phase diagram. Previous studies have confirmed that the 0.43PSN-0.17PMN-0.40PT ceramic consists of a combination of MC (21.19 %) and T (78.81 %) phases and T phase is dominant, implying that similar trend of phase fraction with increased PT content should be obtained in x = 0.06, 0.29 and 0.43 components. The multi-phases coexistence is an intrinsic feature in PSN-PMN-PT system, which is in good agreement with the observations in other PT-based ferroelectrics. The variations of the dielectric permittivity \u03b5 r and dielectric loss factor tan\u03b4 for poled xPSN-(1 \u2212 x \u2212 y)PMN-yPT ceramics with temperature in the range of 30 \u2013 300 \xb0C are illustrated in (a)-(d). All measurements of the curves are measured at a frequency of 1 kHz. As can be observed, for x = 0.06, 0.15, 0.29 and 0.43 ceramics with low PT content, the presence of two distinct dielectric anomalous peaks is observed, corresponding to the phase transition of ferroelectric-ferroelectric (F-F) and ferroelectric-paraelectric (F-P), respectively. With the increasing PT content, the dielectric anomalous peak associated with F-F phase transition (at low temperature T f-f) gradually weakens and only a single dielectric anomalous peak connected with F-P phase transition (at high temperature T c) is obviously observed. The visual phase transition temperatures T f-f and T c for all xPSN-(1 \u2013 x \u2212 y)PMN-yPT samples are depicted in (e). In all ceramics with the same x, the T f-f decreases while T c increases with increasing PT content, which can be ascribed to gradually increased tetragonal phase fraction, since the PT is of tetragonal phase as well as a high T c of 490 \xb0C. Besides, the observation indicates that, for the ceramics with the same PT content, the PSN-PMN-PT system exhibits an increase in both T f-f and T c as the PSN content increases, which results from the larger rhombohedral lattice deformation and higher T c of PSN in comparison with PMN. It should be noted that the tan\u03b4 of all ceramics is less than 0.05 in the whole test temperature range. Additionally, as the PT content increases, the dielectric anomaly peak connected with F-P phase transition in x = 0.06, 0.15, 0.29 and 0.43 ceramics gradually become narrow, indicating the relaxation behavior gradually weakens. Such dielectric relaxor behavior can be demonstrated by the modified Curie-Weiss law of 1/\u025b \u2212 1/\u025b max = (T \u2212 T max)E^{ }/C, where C represents the Curie-Weiss constant, and \u03b3 represents the diffusion coefficient, and \u025b max and T max refer to the maximum dielectric constant and the corresponding temperature, respectively. The fitting results of the representative 0.15PSN-(0.85 \u2212 y)PMN-yPT ceramics are as depicted in (f). The calculated \u03b3 value decreases from 1.79 for y = 0.32 to 1.58 for y = 0.40 ceramics, which can be put down to the reason that PT is a classical ferroelectric. In the meantime, the high \u03b3 signifies the strong relaxor characteristics of the PSN-PMN-PT system, which can be attributed to the intensified ionic disorder and local charge mismatch at B site. (a) shows the variation trend of relative permittivity \u03b5 r of all components. As the PT content increases, the trend of \u03b5 r can be observed to exhibit an initial increase followed by a subsequent decrease in each special x. The maximum value is obtained near y = 0.35, 0.38, 0.39 and 0.41, respectively, for x = 0.06, 0.15, 0.29 and 0.43 ceramics. In combination with XRD analysis, these samples have the two-phase coexistence of T + MC and the T phase is dominant. The polarization-electric field (P \u2212 E) loops of xPSN-(1 \u2212 x \u2212 y)PMN-yPT samples under a 20 kV/cm electric field are depicted in. The presence of well-shaped hysteresis loops with saturation in all samples clearly indicates their well ferroelectricity. (b) displays the remanent polarization P r and coercive electric field E c of the xPSN-(1 \u2212 x \u2212 y)PMN-yPT ceramics. As y increases for each x, it is evident that the values of P r slightly fluctuate around 30 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}, while the E c values gradually increase due to the increase of T phase fraction. For piezoelectric materials, piezoelectric coefficient (d 33) is commonly regarded as a crucial parameter that signifies the capacity to transform external force into charge. In general, the d 33 exhibits a direct correlation with the ferroelectric polarization and dielectric characteristics of piezoelectric ceramics. The equation of d 33\u221d \u03b5 r P r can be used to establish the relationships among them. (c) and (d) present the \u025b r P r and d 33 of xPSN-(1 \u2212 x \u2212 y)PMN-yPT ceramics. It is evident that as PT content increases, both d 33 and \u025b r P r exhibit a similar tendency of initial increase followed by decrease, suggesting the improvement of d 33 is indeed resulted from the enhanced \u025b r P r. The maximum d 33 value for each x occurs at 0.06PSN-0.59PMN-0.35PT, 0.15PSN-0.48PMN-0.37PT, 0.29PSN-0.32PMN-0.39PT and 0.43PSN-0.17PMN-0.40PT samples and the corresponding value is 665, 620, 585, and 650 pC/N, respectively. It should be pointed out that the high d 33 for these ceramics mainly originates from enhanced \u025b r instead of P r, since the P r only presents a slight change. Combining the Rietveld refinement results of x = 0.15, it can be inferred that the high d 33 obtained at y = 0.36, 0.37 mainly results from the easy polarization rotation induced by external electric field owing to the appropriate phase fraction of T + MC. As the PT content is further increased, d 33 shows a marked decrease. Combining the refinement results, the decrease of d 33 can be attributed to the further increasing fraction of the tetragonal phase proportion, because the domain switching gets harder. Moreover, as the x increases, the component with the highest d 33 shifts to the region with higher PT content, which is due to the larger rhombohedral lattice deformation of PSN. The k p shows a similar trend to that of d 33, which exhibits an initial increase followed by a subsequent decrease as the y increases, and the k p value can reach up to 0.67, as depicted in. lists the detailed d 33 and k p values for each ceramic. The piezoelectric performances of piezoceramics are subject to temperature variation due to the thermal depolarization. presents the temperature-dependent pyroelectric current density for the poled 0.06PSN-0.59PMN-0.35PT, 0.15PSN-0.48PMN-0.37PT, 0.29PSN-0.32PMN-0.39PT and 0.43PSN-0.17PMN-0.40PT ceramics. We can obviously see that each sample exhibits two current density peaks and the corresponding temperatures are 70 \xb0C and 181 \xb0C for 0.06PSN-0.59PMN-0.35PT, 75 \xb0C and 200 \xb0C for 0.15PSN-0.48PMN-0.37PT, 75 \xb0C and 226 \xb0C for 0.29PSN-0.32PMN-0.39PT, 68 \xb0C and 248 \xb0C for 0.43PSN-0.17PMN-0.40PT samples. These temperatures are almost in agreement with their T f-f and T c obtained from \u025b r \u2212 T curves. Obviously, the current peak connected with F-F transition for each ceramic is flatter, signifying the good polarization stability. (a) and (b) present the temperature dependence of in-situ k 33 T/k 33 RT and d 33 T/d 33 RT for the poled 0.06PSN-0.59PMN-0.35PT, 0.15PSN-0.48PMN-0.37PT, 0.29PSN-0.32PMN-0.39PT and 0.43PSN-0.17PMN-0.40PT samples. The k 33 T/k 33 RT values of all ceramics display a trend of monotone decrease as the temperature increases. The k 33 T/k 33 RT values of all samples reduce by within 10 % in the test temperature range from 30 to 100 \xb0C. When the test temperature increases to around T c of each ceramic, the k 33 T/k 33 RT only decreases 29 %, 24 %, 15 %, and 24 % for 0.06PSN-0.59PMN-0.35PT, 0.15PSN-0.48PMN-0.37PT, 0.29PSN-0.32PMN-0.39PT and 0.43PSN-0.17PMN-0.40PT ceramics, respectively, demonstrating the k 33 possesses good temperature stability. The in-suit d 33 is calculated by the formula : d = k *(\u03b5 T s E) /E^{33}E^{33}E^{33}E^{33}E^{1}E^{2}, where \u03b5 33 T is the free dielectric constant, s 33 E refers to the elastic compliance coefficient. The temperature dependence of \u03b5 33 T and s 33 E results of xPSN-(1 \u2013 x \u2212 y)PMN-yPT ceramics are depicted in. As presented in (b), as the temperature increases, the variation trend of d 33 T/d 33 RT for each component is similar, showing an increase first and then a decrease near T f-f and T c. The temperature at which the d 33 value suddenly drops commonly refers to the depolarization temperature (T d). The T d values of the ceramic samples are 170 \xb0C (x / y = 0.06 / 0.35), 190 \xb0C (x / y = 0.15 / 0.37), 200 \xb0C (x = / y = 0.29 / 0.39) and 230 \xb0C (x / y = 0.43 / 0.40). From room temperature to the T d of each ceramic, the variation rate of d 33 is 13 %, 7 %, 5 % and 15 % for 0.06PSN-0.59PMN-0.35PT, 0.15PSN-0.48PMN-0.37PT, 0.29PSN-0.32PMN-0.39PT and 0.43PSN-0.17PMN-0.40PT ceramics, respectively. The results mentioned above mean that the PSN-PMN-PT ceramics exhibit a good thermal stability. In order to evaluate the potential of PSN-PMN-PT ceramics in ultrasonic transducers, the 0.06PSN-0.59PMN-0.35PT sample with the highest d 33 of 665 pC/N is chosen as an active element of ultrasonic transducer. (b) and (c) displays the simulated and tested pulse-echo responses and Fourier spectra for the fabricated PSN-PMN-PT transducer, respectively. It can be seen that the measured f c and \u22126 dB bandwidth are 4.65 MHz and 77.4 %, respectively, which agree well with the simulated results (f c \u223c 4.69 MHz and BW \u223c 80.3 %). The \u22126 dB bandwidth of the PSN-PMN-PT transducer surpasses that of other transducers reported in the literature with the similar center frequency , as shown in (d). The IL of the transducer measured at f c is \u221221.45 dB, which is better than the transducer fabricated using PMN-PT single crystal (IL \u223c \u221228.7 dB). According to the obtained data, it can be concluded that PSN-PMN-PT ceramics exhibit great potential for ultrasonic transducer applications.

# TITLE
Phase structure and electrical properties of ternary PSN-PMN-PT ceramics and their applications in ultrasonic transducers

# ABSTRACT
In this work, a series of xPSN-(1 − x − y)PMN-yPT (x = 0.06 − 0.43, y = 0.32 − 0.42) ternary ceramics with different phase structures were synthesized by the solid state reaction method, and the specific phase structure, electrical properties and thermal stability as a function of compositions were investigated. It is found that with the increasing PT content, the phase transition sequence is MC + R → MC + MA + R →MC + T for the ceramics with the same PSN content. Meanwhile, with the increasing PSN content, the MPB compositions shift to higher PT content. The maximum d
                     33 value for x = 0.06, 0.15, 0.29 and 0.43 ceramics occurs at y = 0.35, 0.37, 0.39 and 0.40, respectively, which are dominated by T phase and coexist with a small fraction of MC phase and the corresponding d
                     33 value is 665, 620, 585 and 650 pC/N. From 30 °C to the depolarization temperature T
                     d of each ceramic, the variation rate of d
                     33 is 13 %, 7 %, 5 %, and 15 %, respectively, demonstrating that these ceramics have a good thermal stability. In addition, the 0.06PSN-0.59PMN-0.35PT ceramic with the highest d
                     33 is selected as an active element of ultrasonic transducer, and the ultrasonic transducer with a center frequency of 4.65 MHz was produced. The −6 dB bandwidth and two-way insertion loss are 77.4 % and −21.45 dB, respectively. This work has important implications for the further development of high-performance PT based ferroelectrics.

# INTRODUCTION
Constructing materials with morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) compositions is a simple and practical method to effectively improve the piezoelectric response of ferroelectric ceramics, and it has been widely used in both lead-free and lead-based systems. Among them, the representative Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-PbTiO3 (PMN-PT) relaxor ferroelectrics with MPB compositions have been widely studied because of their extremely high electromechanical coupling coefficient (k 33 > 0.65) and piezoelectric constant (d 33 > 600 pC/N). However, the low phase transition temperature T r-t (60 \u2212 90 \xb0C) and Curie temperature T c (130 \u2212 160 \xb0C) restrict their application in high-temperature environments. For the development of new relaxor ferroelectrics with high T c and T r-t, the researchers introduced end elements with high T c into PMN-PT, obtaining many new ternary systems with rising T c (T c \u2265 200 \xb0C) and T r-t (T r-t \u2265 100 \xb0C), such as Pb(Yb1/2Nb1/2)O3-Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-PbTiO3 (PYN-PMN-PT) , Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3- PbZrO3-PbTiO3 (PMN-PZ-PT) , Pb(In1/2Nb1/2)O3-Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-PbTiO3 (PIN-PMN-PT) , etc. Moreover, in comparison to PMN-PT systems, the T c and d 33 values of the ternary system can be regulated over a wider range, which is advantageous for users to select various components to satisfy the requirements of various applications. For instance, by adjusting the composition, the T c of PYN-PMN-PT can vary between 165 and 370 \xb0C, and the d 33 can vary between 373 and 505 pC/N. For PMN-PT based materials, the selection of end elements has a great influence on the performance. Among all relaxor ferroelectric, Pb(Sc1/2Nb1/2)O3 (PSN) is a typical material with a rhombohedral phase structure and its T c is about 90 \xb0C. The Rhombohedral-Tetragonal MPB of PSN-PT binary system had been successfully constructed near 42 mol% PT, at which high T c, piezoelectric and dielectric properties have been obtained. By combining the MPBs of PMN-PT and PSN-PT, a PSN-PMN-PT ternary system was developed by Yamashita et al. and the d 33 and T c reach 640 pC/N and 205 \xb0C, respectively, in 0.29PSN-0.34PMN-0.37PT composition , which are superior to the PMN-PT system. Recently, the improved thermal stability and piezoelectric performances of PSN-PMN-PT through composition design, ion doping and composite method. As reported by Guo et al., the d 33 and T c of 0.43PSN-0.17PMN-0.40PT composition are 650 pC/N and 255 \xb0C, respectively, in the meantime, the variation rate of d 33 remains below 20 % within a temperature range of 30 \u2013 250 \xb0C. Dong et al. conducted an investigation on 0.15PSN-(0.85 \u2212 x)PMN-xPT ceramics doped with 2 mol% SmE^{3 +}, finding that the d 33 reaches 815 pC/N when x = 0.33, and the d 33 varies by only 8 % over the test temperature range of 30 \u2212 110 \xb0C. Guo et al. noted that the composite ceramic of 0.15PSN-0.51PMN-0.34PT/0.05 mol ZnO exhibits an improved d 33 (590 pC/N) compared to pure 0.15PSN-0.51PMN-0.34PT (d 33 = 529 pC/N), and after annealing at 200 \xb0C, the retained d 33 maintains 92 % of the value before annealing. The results above mentioned show that PSN-PMN-PT system has great potential for practical applications. These questions are essential to comprehend the physical principles underlying the excellent performance of this system, which are very critical for the further development of PSN-PMN-PT solid solution as well as the component design for other ternary systems. In this study, the ternary xPSN-(1 \u2212 x \u2212 y)PMN-yPT (x = 0.06 \u2212 0.43, y = 0.32 \u2212 0.42) ceramics with different phase structures (rhombohedral, tetragonal and monoclinic phases) were established via the linear combination rule, as shown in. The phase structure, electrical properties and thermal stability of PSN-PMN-PT ceramics were analyzed in detail. Furthermore, to evaluate the potential in applications, an ultrasonic transducer with a center frequency (f c) of 4.65 MHz was fabricated using PSN-PMN-PT ceramic as an active element and the \u22126 dB bandwidth (BW) and two-way insertion loss (IL) were measured.

# CONCLUSION
In summary, xPSN-(1 \u2212 x \u2212 y)PMN-yPT (x = 0.06 \u2212 0.43, y = 0.32 \u2212 0.42) ceramics were fabricated with different phase structure. The consequences revealed that as the PT content rises, the ceramics with identical PSN content demonstrate a phase transition sequence of MC + R \u2192 MC + MA + R \u2192 MC + T. Meanwhile, as the PSN content increases, the MPB compositions exhibit a shift toward higher PT content. The maximum d 33 value for each x is obtained at 0.06PSN-0.59PMN-0.35PT, 0.15PSN-0.48PMN-0.37PT, 0.29PSN-0.32PMN-0.39PT and 0.43PSN-0.17PMN-0.40PT ceramics, in which both T and MC phases coexist but the T phase is dominant, and the corresponding value is 665, 620, 585, and 650 pC/N, respectively. The d 33 variation rates of these ceramics, ranging from room temperature to the T d of each ceramic, are 13 %, 7 %, 5 %, and 15 %, respectively, indicating that these ceramics have a good thermal stability. Moreover, the ultrasonic transducer (f c \u223c 4.69 MHz) was prepared using the 0.06PSN-0.59PMN-0.35PT ceramic with the highest d 33 as an active element. The \u22126 dB bandwidth is 77.4 % and two-way insertion loss is \u221221.45 dB. The findings of this study have guiding significance for the advancement of high-performance PT-based ferroelectric ceramics.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
displays the XRD patterns of xPSN-(1 \u2212 x \u2212 y)PMN-yPT ceramics. Each sample is of pure perovskite structure without pyrochlore phase, which implies that PSN and PMN-PT have successfully formed a solid solution. For PT-based ferroelectric systems, the change of the phase structure can generally be reflected through the diffraction peak of (200) around 45\xb0. (b), (d), (f) and (h) depict the evolution of (200) diffraction peak with the variable composition. It is evident that with the increasing PT content, the same variation trend of the (200) peak is observed for PSN-PMN-PT samples with different x (x = 0.06, 0.15, 0.29, and 0.43). Taking the x = 0.15 ceramics as an example, when the PT content is less than 0.35 mol (y < 0.35), the (200) diffraction peak is single and the crystalline structure of these compositions is dominated by rhombohedral phase. As y increases to 0.35, the (200) peak starts to broaden, indicating that the phase transition begins in this component. When y further increases, a shoulder on the left side of the (200) peak occurs and its relative intensity gradually increases. As y rises to 0.40, the (200) peak almost splits into (200) and (002), suggesting that the tetragonal phase is dominant. For PT-based ferroelectric ceramics, grain size is one of the key factors affecting their electric properties, because the grain size determines the domain size, which is closely related to electric properties. As an example, presents the surface SEM images of the 0.15PSN-(0.85 \u2212 y)PMN-yPT, and illustrate the corresponding grain size distribution. The bulk density of these ceramics varies between 7.5 and 7.85 g/cmE^{3}, and the relative densities are greater than 95 %. According to the grain size distribution in , it has been observed that the mean grain size for all 0.15PSN-(0.85 \u2212 y)PMN-yPT ceramics varies within a small range of 1.9 \u2212 2.38 \u03bcm, indicating the influence of grain size on the electric performances of x = 0.15 ceramics with different PT content can be ignored. This conclusion also applies to x = 0.06, 0.29, and 0.43 ceramics with different PT content in this study. To further determine the composition-induced phase transition behaviors of the PSN-PMN-PT ceramics, the fitting of the XRD patterns of x = 0.15 ceramics were fitted using the Rietveld refinement , the refined results are presented in and. The optimal Rietveld refinement results are achieved for all x = 0.15 ceramics by using the following phase models: R3m + Pm (R + MC) for y = 0.32 \u2212 0.33, R3m + Pm + Cm (R + Mc + MA) for y = 0.34, and P4mm + Pm (T + MC) for y = 0.35 \u2212 0.40, demonstrating that multi-phases with competing symmetries coexist in the PSN-PMN-PT system. The detailed phase volume fractions of all x = 0.15 ceramics based on the refined results is exhibited in. Clearly, in the ceramics with y = 0.32 and 0.33, the R and MC phases coexist and MC phase is dominant, and the MC phase fraction is 72 % and 89 %, respectively. For y = 0.34 ceramic, the three-phase coexistence of MC, MA and R is observed, with volume fractions of 84 %, 6 % and 10 %, respectively. When the y exceeds 0.34, R and MA phases disappear, and the samples show the two-phase coexistence of MC and T. Moreover, as the y rises from 0.35 to 0.40, the T phase fraction progressively increased from 20 % to 70 % and the MC phase fraction decreased from 80 % to 30 %. The results of the phase fraction for x = 0.15 ceramics are consistent with the analysis in (b) and are also in agreement with the phase diagram. Previous studies have confirmed that the 0.43PSN-0.17PMN-0.40PT ceramic consists of a combination of MC (21.19 %) and T (78.81 %) phases and T phase is dominant, implying that similar trend of phase fraction with increased PT content should be obtained in x = 0.06, 0.29 and 0.43 components. The multi-phases coexistence is an intrinsic feature in PSN-PMN-PT system, which is in good agreement with the observations in other PT-based ferroelectrics. The variations of the dielectric permittivity \u03b5 r and dielectric loss factor tan\u03b4 for poled xPSN-(1 \u2212 x \u2212 y)PMN-yPT ceramics with temperature in the range of 30 \u2013 300 \xb0C are illustrated in (a)-(d). All measurements of the curves are measured at a frequency of 1 kHz. As can be observed, for x = 0.06, 0.15, 0.29 and 0.43 ceramics with low PT content, the presence of two distinct dielectric anomalous peaks is observed, corresponding to the phase transition of ferroelectric-ferroelectric (F-F) and ferroelectric-paraelectric (F-P), respectively. With the increasing PT content, the dielectric anomalous peak associated with F-F phase transition (at low temperature T f-f) gradually weakens and only a single dielectric anomalous peak connected with F-P phase transition (at high temperature T c) is obviously observed. The visual phase transition temperatures T f-f and T c for all xPSN-(1 \u2013 x \u2212 y)PMN-yPT samples are depicted in (e). In all ceramics with the same x, the T f-f decreases while T c increases with increasing PT content, which can be ascribed to gradually increased tetragonal phase fraction, since the PT is of tetragonal phase as well as a high T c of 490 \xb0C. Besides, the observation indicates that, for the ceramics with the same PT content, the PSN-PMN-PT system exhibits an increase in both T f-f and T c as the PSN content increases, which results from the larger rhombohedral lattice deformation and higher T c of PSN in comparison with PMN. It should be noted that the tan\u03b4 of all ceramics is less than 0.05 in the whole test temperature range. Additionally, as the PT content increases, the dielectric anomaly peak connected with F-P phase transition in x = 0.06, 0.15, 0.29 and 0.43 ceramics gradually become narrow, indicating the relaxation behavior gradually weakens. Such dielectric relaxor behavior can be demonstrated by the modified Curie-Weiss law of 1/\u025b \u2212 1/\u025b max = (T \u2212 T max)E^{ }/C, where C represents the Curie-Weiss constant, and \u03b3 represents the diffusion coefficient, and \u025b max and T max refer to the maximum dielectric constant and the corresponding temperature, respectively. The fitting results of the representative 0.15PSN-(0.85 \u2212 y)PMN-yPT ceramics are as depicted in (f). The calculated \u03b3 value decreases from 1.79 for y = 0.32 to 1.58 for y = 0.40 ceramics, which can be put down to the reason that PT is a classical ferroelectric. In the meantime, the high \u03b3 signifies the strong relaxor characteristics of the PSN-PMN-PT system, which can be attributed to the intensified ionic disorder and local charge mismatch at B site. (a) shows the variation trend of relative permittivity \u03b5 r of all components. As the PT content increases, the trend of \u03b5 r can be observed to exhibit an initial increase followed by a subsequent decrease in each special x. The maximum value is obtained near y = 0.35, 0.38, 0.39 and 0.41, respectively, for x = 0.06, 0.15, 0.29 and 0.43 ceramics. In combination with XRD analysis, these samples have the two-phase coexistence of T + MC and the T phase is dominant. The polarization-electric field (P \u2212 E) loops of xPSN-(1 \u2212 x \u2212 y)PMN-yPT samples under a 20 kV/cm electric field are depicted in. The presence of well-shaped hysteresis loops with saturation in all samples clearly indicates their well ferroelectricity. (b) displays the remanent polarization P r and coercive electric field E c of the xPSN-(1 \u2212 x \u2212 y)PMN-yPT ceramics. As y increases for each x, it is evident that the values of P r slightly fluctuate around 30 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}, while the E c values gradually increase due to the increase of T phase fraction. For piezoelectric materials, piezoelectric coefficient (d 33) is commonly regarded as a crucial parameter that signifies the capacity to transform external force into charge. In general, the d 33 exhibits a direct correlation with the ferroelectric polarization and dielectric characteristics of piezoelectric ceramics. The equation of d 33\u221d \u03b5 r P r can be used to establish the relationships among them. (c) and (d) present the \u025b r P r and d 33 of xPSN-(1 \u2212 x \u2212 y)PMN-yPT ceramics. It is evident that as PT content increases, both d 33 and \u025b r P r exhibit a similar tendency of initial increase followed by decrease, suggesting the improvement of d 33 is indeed resulted from the enhanced \u025b r P r. The maximum d 33 value for each x occurs at 0.06PSN-0.59PMN-0.35PT, 0.15PSN-0.48PMN-0.37PT, 0.29PSN-0.32PMN-0.39PT and 0.43PSN-0.17PMN-0.40PT samples and the corresponding value is 665, 620, 585, and 650 pC/N, respectively. It should be pointed out that the high d 33 for these ceramics mainly originates from enhanced \u025b r instead of P r, since the P r only presents a slight change. Combining the Rietveld refinement results of x = 0.15, it can be inferred that the high d 33 obtained at y = 0.36, 0.37 mainly results from the easy polarization rotation induced by external electric field owing to the appropriate phase fraction of T + MC. As the PT content is further increased, d 33 shows a marked decrease. Combining the refinement results, the decrease of d 33 can be attributed to the further increasing fraction of the tetragonal phase proportion, because the domain switching gets harder. Moreover, as the x increases, the component with the highest d 33 shifts to the region with higher PT content, which is due to the larger rhombohedral lattice deformation of PSN. The k p shows a similar trend to that of d 33, which exhibits an initial increase followed by a subsequent decrease as the y increases, and the k p value can reach up to 0.67, as depicted in. lists the detailed d 33 and k p values for each ceramic. The piezoelectric performances of piezoceramics are subject to temperature variation due to the thermal depolarization. presents the temperature-dependent pyroelectric current density for the poled 0.06PSN-0.59PMN-0.35PT, 0.15PSN-0.48PMN-0.37PT, 0.29PSN-0.32PMN-0.39PT and 0.43PSN-0.17PMN-0.40PT ceramics. We can obviously see that each sample exhibits two current density peaks and the corresponding temperatures are 70 \xb0C and 181 \xb0C for 0.06PSN-0.59PMN-0.35PT, 75 \xb0C and 200 \xb0C for 0.15PSN-0.48PMN-0.37PT, 75 \xb0C and 226 \xb0C for 0.29PSN-0.32PMN-0.39PT, 68 \xb0C and 248 \xb0C for 0.43PSN-0.17PMN-0.40PT samples. These temperatures are almost in agreement with their T f-f and T c obtained from \u025b r \u2212 T curves. Obviously, the current peak connected with F-F transition for each ceramic is flatter, signifying the good polarization stability. (a) and (b) present the temperature dependence of in-situ k 33 T/k 33 RT and d 33 T/d 33 RT for the poled 0.06PSN-0.59PMN-0.35PT, 0.15PSN-0.48PMN-0.37PT, 0.29PSN-0.32PMN-0.39PT and 0.43PSN-0.17PMN-0.40PT samples. The k 33 T/k 33 RT values of all ceramics display a trend of monotone decrease as the temperature increases. The k 33 T/k 33 RT values of all samples reduce by within 10 % in the test temperature range from 30 to 100 \xb0C. When the test temperature increases to around T c of each ceramic, the k 33 T/k 33 RT only decreases 29 %, 24 %, 15 %, and 24 % for 0.06PSN-0.59PMN-0.35PT, 0.15PSN-0.48PMN-0.37PT, 0.29PSN-0.32PMN-0.39PT and 0.43PSN-0.17PMN-0.40PT ceramics, respectively, demonstrating the k 33 possesses good temperature stability. The in-suit d 33 is calculated by the formula : d = k *(\u03b5 T s E) /E^{33}E^{33}E^{33}E^{33}E^{1}E^{2}, where \u03b5 33 T is the free dielectric constant, s 33 E refers to the elastic compliance coefficient. The temperature dependence of \u03b5 33 T and s 33 E results of xPSN-(1 \u2013 x \u2212 y)PMN-yPT ceramics are depicted in. As presented in (b), as the temperature increases, the variation trend of d 33 T/d 33 RT for each component is similar, showing an increase first and then a decrease near T f-f and T c. The temperature at which the d 33 value suddenly drops commonly refers to the depolarization temperature (T d). The T d values of the ceramic samples are 170 \xb0C (x / y = 0.06 / 0.35), 190 \xb0C (x / y = 0.15 / 0.37), 200 \xb0C (x = / y = 0.29 / 0.39) and 230 \xb0C (x / y = 0.43 / 0.40). From room temperature to the T d of each ceramic, the variation rate of d 33 is 13 %, 7 %, 5 % and 15 % for 0.06PSN-0.59PMN-0.35PT, 0.15PSN-0.48PMN-0.37PT, 0.29PSN-0.32PMN-0.39PT and 0.43PSN-0.17PMN-0.40PT ceramics, respectively. The results mentioned above mean that the PSN-PMN-PT ceramics exhibit a good thermal stability. In order to evaluate the potential of PSN-PMN-PT ceramics in ultrasonic transducers, the 0.06PSN-0.59PMN-0.35PT sample with the highest d 33 of 665 pC/N is chosen as an active element of ultrasonic transducer. (b) and (c) displays the simulated and tested pulse-echo responses and Fourier spectra for the fabricated PSN-PMN-PT transducer, respectively. It can be seen that the measured f c and \u22126 dB bandwidth are 4.65 MHz and 77.4 %, respectively, which agree well with the simulated results (f c \u223c 4.69 MHz and BW \u223c 80.3 %). The \u22126 dB bandwidth of the PSN-PMN-PT transducer surpasses that of other transducers reported in the literature with the similar center frequency , as shown in (d). The IL of the transducer measured at f c is \u221221.45 dB, which is better than the transducer fabricated using PMN-PT single crystal (IL \u223c \u221228.7 dB). According to the obtained data, it can be concluded that PSN-PMN-PT ceramics exhibit great potential for ultrasonic transducer applications.

# INTRODUCTION
Constructing materials with morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) compositions is a simple and practical method to effectively improve the piezoelectric response of ferroelectric ceramics, and it has been widely used in both lead-free and lead-based systems. Among them, the representative Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-PbTiO3 (PMN-PT) relaxor ferroelectrics with MPB compositions have been widely studied because of their extremely high electromechanical coupling coefficient (k 33 > 0.65) and piezoelectric constant (d 33 > 600 pC/N). However, the low phase transition temperature T r-t (60 \u2212 90 \xb0C) and Curie temperature T c (130 \u2212 160 \xb0C) restrict their application in high-temperature environments. For the development of new relaxor ferroelectrics with high T c and T r-t, the researchers introduced end elements with high T c into PMN-PT, obtaining many new ternary systems with rising T c (T c \u2265 200 \xb0C) and T r-t (T r-t \u2265 100 \xb0C), such as Pb(Yb1/2Nb1/2)O3-Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-PbTiO3 (PYN-PMN-PT) , Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3- PbZrO3-PbTiO3 (PMN-PZ-PT) , Pb(In1/2Nb1/2)O3-Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-PbTiO3 (PIN-PMN-PT) , etc. Moreover, in comparison to PMN-PT systems, the T c and d 33 values of the ternary system can be regulated over a wider range, which is advantageous for users to select various components to satisfy the requirements of various applications. For instance, by adjusting the composition, the T c of PYN-PMN-PT can vary between 165 and 370 \xb0C, and the d 33 can vary between 373 and 505 pC/N. For PMN-PT based materials, the selection of end elements has a great influence on the performance. Among all relaxor ferroelectric, Pb(Sc1/2Nb1/2)O3 (PSN) is a typical material with a rhombohedral phase structure and its T c is about 90 \xb0C. The Rhombohedral-Tetragonal MPB of PSN-PT binary system had been successfully constructed near 42 mol% PT, at which high T c, piezoelectric and dielectric properties have been obtained. By combining the MPBs of PMN-PT and PSN-PT, a PSN-PMN-PT ternary system was developed by Yamashita et al. and the d 33 and T c reach 640 pC/N and 205 \xb0C, respectively, in 0.29PSN-0.34PMN-0.37PT composition , which are superior to the PMN-PT system. Recently, the improved thermal stability and piezoelectric performances of PSN-PMN-PT through composition design, ion doping and composite method. As reported by Guo et al., the d 33 and T c of 0.43PSN-0.17PMN-0.40PT composition are 650 pC/N and 255 \xb0C, respectively, in the meantime, the variation rate of d 33 remains below 20 % within a temperature range of 30 \u2013 250 \xb0C. Dong et al. conducted an investigation on 0.15PSN-(0.85 \u2212 x)PMN-xPT ceramics doped with 2 mol% SmE^{3 +}, finding that the d 33 reaches 815 pC/N when x = 0.33, and the d 33 varies by only 8 % over the test temperature range of 30 \u2212 110 \xb0C. Guo et al. noted that the composite ceramic of 0.15PSN-0.51PMN-0.34PT/0.05 mol ZnO exhibits an improved d 33 (590 pC/N) compared to pure 0.15PSN-0.51PMN-0.34PT (d 33 = 529 pC/N), and after annealing at 200 \xb0C, the retained d 33 maintains 92 % of the value before annealing. The results above mentioned show that PSN-PMN-PT system has great potential for practical applications. These questions are essential to comprehend the physical principles underlying the excellent performance of this system, which are very critical for the further development of PSN-PMN-PT solid solution as well as the component design for other ternary systems. In this study, the ternary xPSN-(1 \u2212 x \u2212 y)PMN-yPT (x = 0.06 \u2212 0.43, y = 0.32 \u2212 0.42) ceramics with different phase structures (rhombohedral, tetragonal and monoclinic phases) were established via the linear combination rule, as shown in. The phase structure, electrical properties and thermal stability of PSN-PMN-PT ceramics were analyzed in detail. Furthermore, to evaluate the potential in applications, an ultrasonic transducer with a center frequency (f c) of 4.65 MHz was fabricated using PSN-PMN-PT ceramic as an active element and the \u22126 dB bandwidth (BW) and two-way insertion loss (IL) were measured.

# CONCLUSION
In summary, xPSN-(1 \u2212 x \u2212 y)PMN-yPT (x = 0.06 \u2212 0.43, y = 0.32 \u2212 0.42) ceramics were fabricated with different phase structure. The consequences revealed that as the PT content rises, the ceramics with identical PSN content demonstrate a phase transition sequence of MC + R \u2192 MC + MA + R \u2192 MC + T. Meanwhile, as the PSN content increases, the MPB compositions exhibit a shift toward higher PT content. The maximum d 33 value for each x is obtained at 0.06PSN-0.59PMN-0.35PT, 0.15PSN-0.48PMN-0.37PT, 0.29PSN-0.32PMN-0.39PT and 0.43PSN-0.17PMN-0.40PT ceramics, in which both T and MC phases coexist but the T phase is dominant, and the corresponding value is 665, 620, 585, and 650 pC/N, respectively. The d 33 variation rates of these ceramics, ranging from room temperature to the T d of each ceramic, are 13 %, 7 %, 5 %, and 15 %, respectively, indicating that these ceramics have a good thermal stability. Moreover, the ultrasonic transducer (f c \u223c 4.69 MHz) was prepared using the 0.06PSN-0.59PMN-0.35PT ceramic with the highest d 33 as an active element. The \u22126 dB bandwidth is 77.4 % and two-way insertion loss is \u221221.45 dB. The findings of this study have guiding significance for the advancement of high-performance PT-based ferroelectric ceramics.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
displays the XRD patterns of xPSN-(1 \u2212 x \u2212 y)PMN-yPT ceramics. Each sample is of pure perovskite structure without pyrochlore phase, which implies that PSN and PMN-PT have successfully formed a solid solution. For PT-based ferroelectric systems, the change of the phase structure can generally be reflected through the diffraction peak of (200) around 45\xb0. (b), (d), (f) and (h) depict the evolution of (200) diffraction peak with the variable composition. It is evident that with the increasing PT content, the same variation trend of the (200) peak is observed for PSN-PMN-PT samples with different x (x = 0.06, 0.15, 0.29, and 0.43). Taking the x = 0.15 ceramics as an example, when the PT content is less than 0.35 mol (y < 0.35), the (200) diffraction peak is single and the crystalline structure of these compositions is dominated by rhombohedral phase. As y increases to 0.35, the (200) peak starts to broaden, indicating that the phase transition begins in this component. When y further increases, a shoulder on the left side of the (200) peak occurs and its relative intensity gradually increases. As y rises to 0.40, the (200) peak almost splits into (200) and (002), suggesting that the tetragonal phase is dominant. For PT-based ferroelectric ceramics, grain size is one of the key factors affecting their electric properties, because the grain size determines the domain size, which is closely related to electric properties. As an example, presents the surface SEM images of the 0.15PSN-(0.85 \u2212 y)PMN-yPT, and illustrate the corresponding grain size distribution. The bulk density of these ceramics varies between 7.5 and 7.85 g/cmE^{3}, and the relative densities are greater than 95 %. According to the grain size distribution in , it has been observed that the mean grain size for all 0.15PSN-(0.85 \u2212 y)PMN-yPT ceramics varies within a small range of 1.9 \u2212 2.38 \u03bcm, indicating the influence of grain size on the electric performances of x = 0.15 ceramics with different PT content can be ignored. This conclusion also applies to x = 0.06, 0.29, and 0.43 ceramics with different PT content in this study. To further determine the composition-induced phase transition behaviors of the PSN-PMN-PT ceramics, the fitting of the XRD patterns of x = 0.15 ceramics were fitted using the Rietveld refinement , the refined results are presented in and. The optimal Rietveld refinement results are achieved for all x = 0.15 ceramics by using the following phase models: R3m + Pm (R + MC) for y = 0.32 \u2212 0.33, R3m + Pm + Cm (R + Mc + MA) for y = 0.34, and P4mm + Pm (T + MC) for y = 0.35 \u2212 0.40, demonstrating that multi-phases with competing symmetries coexist in the PSN-PMN-PT system. The detailed phase volume fractions of all x = 0.15 ceramics based on the refined results is exhibited in. Clearly, in the ceramics with y = 0.32 and 0.33, the R and MC phases coexist and MC phase is dominant, and the MC phase fraction is 72 % and 89 %, respectively. For y = 0.34 ceramic, the three-phase coexistence of MC, MA and R is observed, with volume fractions of 84 %, 6 % and 10 %, respectively. When the y exceeds 0.34, R and MA phases disappear, and the samples show the two-phase coexistence of MC and T. Moreover, as the y rises from 0.35 to 0.40, the T phase fraction progressively increased from 20 % to 70 % and the MC phase fraction decreased from 80 % to 30 %. The results of the phase fraction for x = 0.15 ceramics are consistent with the analysis in (b) and are also in agreement with the phase diagram. Previous studies have confirmed that the 0.43PSN-0.17PMN-0.40PT ceramic consists of a combination of MC (21.19 %) and T (78.81 %) phases and T phase is dominant, implying that similar trend of phase fraction with increased PT content should be obtained in x = 0.06, 0.29 and 0.43 components. The multi-phases coexistence is an intrinsic feature in PSN-PMN-PT system, which is in good agreement with the observations in other PT-based ferroelectrics. The variations of the dielectric permittivity \u03b5 r and dielectric loss factor tan\u03b4 for poled xPSN-(1 \u2212 x \u2212 y)PMN-yPT ceramics with temperature in the range of 30 \u2013 300 \xb0C are illustrated in (a)-(d). All measurements of the curves are measured at a frequency of 1 kHz. As can be observed, for x = 0.06, 0.15, 0.29 and 0.43 ceramics with low PT content, the presence of two distinct dielectric anomalous peaks is observed, corresponding to the phase transition of ferroelectric-ferroelectric (F-F) and ferroelectric-paraelectric (F-P), respectively. With the increasing PT content, the dielectric anomalous peak associated with F-F phase transition (at low temperature T f-f) gradually weakens and only a single dielectric anomalous peak connected with F-P phase transition (at high temperature T c) is obviously observed. The visual phase transition temperatures T f-f and T c for all xPSN-(1 \u2013 x \u2212 y)PMN-yPT samples are depicted in (e). In all ceramics with the same x, the T f-f decreases while T c increases with increasing PT content, which can be ascribed to gradually increased tetragonal phase fraction, since the PT is of tetragonal phase as well as a high T c of 490 \xb0C. Besides, the observation indicates that, for the ceramics with the same PT content, the PSN-PMN-PT system exhibits an increase in both T f-f and T c as the PSN content increases, which results from the larger rhombohedral lattice deformation and higher T c of PSN in comparison with PMN. It should be noted that the tan\u03b4 of all ceramics is less than 0.05 in the whole test temperature range. Additionally, as the PT content increases, the dielectric anomaly peak connected with F-P phase transition in x = 0.06, 0.15, 0.29 and 0.43 ceramics gradually become narrow, indicating the relaxation behavior gradually weakens. Such dielectric relaxor behavior can be demonstrated by the modified Curie-Weiss law of 1/\u025b \u2212 1/\u025b max = (T \u2212 T max)E^{ }/C, where C represents the Curie-Weiss constant, and \u03b3 represents the diffusion coefficient, and \u025b max and T max refer to the maximum dielectric constant and the corresponding temperature, respectively. The fitting results of the representative 0.15PSN-(0.85 \u2212 y)PMN-yPT ceramics are as depicted in (f). The calculated \u03b3 value decreases from 1.79 for y = 0.32 to 1.58 for y = 0.40 ceramics, which can be put down to the reason that PT is a classical ferroelectric. In the meantime, the high \u03b3 signifies the strong relaxor characteristics of the PSN-PMN-PT system, which can be attributed to the intensified ionic disorder and local charge mismatch at B site. (a) shows the variation trend of relative permittivity \u03b5 r of all components. As the PT content increases, the trend of \u03b5 r can be observed to exhibit an initial increase followed by a subsequent decrease in each special x. The maximum value is obtained near y = 0.35, 0.38, 0.39 and 0.41, respectively, for x = 0.06, 0.15, 0.29 and 0.43 ceramics. In combination with XRD analysis, these samples have the two-phase coexistence of T + MC and the T phase is dominant. The polarization-electric field (P \u2212 E) loops of xPSN-(1 \u2212 x \u2212 y)PMN-yPT samples under a 20 kV/cm electric field are depicted in. The presence of well-shaped hysteresis loops with saturation in all samples clearly indicates their well ferroelectricity. (b) displays the remanent polarization P r and coercive electric field E c of the xPSN-(1 \u2212 x \u2212 y)PMN-yPT ceramics. As y increases for each x, it is evident that the values of P r slightly fluctuate around 30 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}, while the E c values gradually increase due to the increase of T phase fraction. For piezoelectric materials, piezoelectric coefficient (d 33) is commonly regarded as a crucial parameter that signifies the capacity to transform external force into charge. In general, the d 33 exhibits a direct correlation with the ferroelectric polarization and dielectric characteristics of piezoelectric ceramics. The equation of d 33\u221d \u03b5 r P r can be used to establish the relationships among them. (c) and (d) present the \u025b r P r and d 33 of xPSN-(1 \u2212 x \u2212 y)PMN-yPT ceramics. It is evident that as PT content increases, both d 33 and \u025b r P r exhibit a similar tendency of initial increase followed by decrease, suggesting the improvement of d 33 is indeed resulted from the enhanced \u025b r P r. The maximum d 33 value for each x occurs at 0.06PSN-0.59PMN-0.35PT, 0.15PSN-0.48PMN-0.37PT, 0.29PSN-0.32PMN-0.39PT and 0.43PSN-0.17PMN-0.40PT samples and the corresponding value is 665, 620, 585, and 650 pC/N, respectively. It should be pointed out that the high d 33 for these ceramics mainly originates from enhanced \u025b r instead of P r, since the P r only presents a slight change. Combining the Rietveld refinement results of x = 0.15, it can be inferred that the high d 33 obtained at y = 0.36, 0.37 mainly results from the easy polarization rotation induced by external electric field owing to the appropriate phase fraction of T + MC. As the PT content is further increased, d 33 shows a marked decrease. Combining the refinement results, the decrease of d 33 can be attributed to the further increasing fraction of the tetragonal phase proportion, because the domain switching gets harder. Moreover, as the x increases, the component with the highest d 33 shifts to the region with higher PT content, which is due to the larger rhombohedral lattice deformation of PSN. The k p shows a similar trend to that of d 33, which exhibits an initial increase followed by a subsequent decrease as the y increases, and the k p value can reach up to 0.67, as depicted in. lists the detailed d 33 and k p values for each ceramic. The piezoelectric performances of piezoceramics are subject to temperature variation due to the thermal depolarization. presents the temperature-dependent pyroelectric current density for the poled 0.06PSN-0.59PMN-0.35PT, 0.15PSN-0.48PMN-0.37PT, 0.29PSN-0.32PMN-0.39PT and 0.43PSN-0.17PMN-0.40PT ceramics. We can obviously see that each sample exhibits two current density peaks and the corresponding temperatures are 70 \xb0C and 181 \xb0C for 0.06PSN-0.59PMN-0.35PT, 75 \xb0C and 200 \xb0C for 0.15PSN-0.48PMN-0.37PT, 75 \xb0C and 226 \xb0C for 0.29PSN-0.32PMN-0.39PT, 68 \xb0C and 248 \xb0C for 0.43PSN-0.17PMN-0.40PT samples. These temperatures are almost in agreement with their T f-f and T c obtained from \u025b r \u2212 T curves. Obviously, the current peak connected with F-F transition for each ceramic is flatter, signifying the good polarization stability. (a) and (b) present the temperature dependence of in-situ k 33 T/k 33 RT and d 33 T/d 33 RT for the poled 0.06PSN-0.59PMN-0.35PT, 0.15PSN-0.48PMN-0.37PT, 0.29PSN-0.32PMN-0.39PT and 0.43PSN-0.17PMN-0.40PT samples. The k 33 T/k 33 RT values of all ceramics display a trend of monotone decrease as the temperature increases. The k 33 T/k 33 RT values of all samples reduce by within 10 % in the test temperature range from 30 to 100 \xb0C. When the test temperature increases to around T c of each ceramic, the k 33 T/k 33 RT only decreases 29 %, 24 %, 15 %, and 24 % for 0.06PSN-0.59PMN-0.35PT, 0.15PSN-0.48PMN-0.37PT, 0.29PSN-0.32PMN-0.39PT and 0.43PSN-0.17PMN-0.40PT ceramics, respectively, demonstrating the k 33 possesses good temperature stability. The in-suit d 33 is calculated by the formula : d = k *(\u03b5 T s E) /E^{33}E^{33}E^{33}E^{33}E^{1}E^{2}, where \u03b5 33 T is the free dielectric constant, s 33 E refers to the elastic compliance coefficient. The temperature dependence of \u03b5 33 T and s 33 E results of xPSN-(1 \u2013 x \u2212 y)PMN-yPT ceramics are depicted in. As presented in (b), as the temperature increases, the variation trend of d 33 T/d 33 RT for each component is similar, showing an increase first and then a decrease near T f-f and T c. The temperature at which the d 33 value suddenly drops commonly refers to the depolarization temperature (T d). The T d values of the ceramic samples are 170 \xb0C (x / y = 0.06 / 0.35), 190 \xb0C (x / y = 0.15 / 0.37), 200 \xb0C (x = / y = 0.29 / 0.39) and 230 \xb0C (x / y = 0.43 / 0.40). From room temperature to the T d of each ceramic, the variation rate of d 33 is 13 %, 7 %, 5 % and 15 % for 0.06PSN-0.59PMN-0.35PT, 0.15PSN-0.48PMN-0.37PT, 0.29PSN-0.32PMN-0.39PT and 0.43PSN-0.17PMN-0.40PT ceramics, respectively. The results mentioned above mean that the PSN-PMN-PT ceramics exhibit a good thermal stability. In order to evaluate the potential of PSN-PMN-PT ceramics in ultrasonic transducers, the 0.06PSN-0.59PMN-0.35PT sample with the highest d 33 of 665 pC/N is chosen as an active element of ultrasonic transducer. (b) and (c) displays the simulated and tested pulse-echo responses and Fourier spectra for the fabricated PSN-PMN-PT transducer, respectively. It can be seen that the measured f c and \u22126 dB bandwidth are 4.65 MHz and 77.4 %, respectively, which agree well with the simulated results (f c \u223c 4.69 MHz and BW \u223c 80.3 %). The \u22126 dB bandwidth of the PSN-PMN-PT transducer surpasses that of other transducers reported in the literature with the similar center frequency , as shown in (d). The IL of the transducer measured at f c is \u221221.45 dB, which is better than the transducer fabricated using PMN-PT single crystal (IL \u223c \u221228.7 dB). According to the obtained data, it can be concluded that PSN-PMN-PT ceramics exhibit great potential for ultrasonic transducer applications.

# ABSTRACT
In this work, a series of xPSN-(1 − x − y)PMN-yPT (x = 0.06 − 0.43, y = 0.32 − 0.42) ternary ceramics with different phase structures were synthesized by the solid state reaction method, and the specific phase structure, electrical properties and thermal stability as a function of compositions were investigated. It is found that with the increasing PT content, the phase transition sequence is MC + R → MC + MA + R →MC + T for the ceramics with the same PSN content. Meanwhile, with the increasing PSN content, the MPB compositions shift to higher PT content. The maximum d

# INTRODUCTION
Constructing materials with morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) compositions is a simple and practical method to effectively improve the piezoelectric response of ferroelectric ceramics, and it has been widely used in both lead-free and lead-based systems. Among them, the representative Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-PbTiO3 (PMN-PT) relaxor ferroelectrics with MPB compositions have been widely studied because of their extremely high electromechanical coupling coefficient (k 33 > 0.65) and piezoelectric constant (d 33 > 600 pC/N). However, the low phase transition temperature T r-t (60 \u2212 90 \xb0C) and Curie temperature T c (130 \u2212 160 \xb0C) restrict their application in high-temperature environments. For the development of new relaxor ferroelectrics with high T c and T r-t, the researchers introduced end elements with high T c into PMN-PT, obtaining many new ternary systems with rising T c (T c \u2265 200 \xb0C) and T r-t (T r-t \u2265 100 \xb0C), such as Pb(Yb1/2Nb1/2)O3-Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-PbTiO3 (PYN-PMN-PT) , Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3- PbZrO3-PbTiO3 (PMN-PZ-PT) , Pb(In1/2Nb1/2)O3-Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-PbTiO3 (PIN-PMN-PT) , etc. Moreover, in comparison to PMN-PT systems, the T c and d 33 values of the ternary system can be regulated over a wider range, which is advantageous for users to select various components to satisfy the requirements of various applications. For instance, by adjusting the composition, the T c of PYN-PMN-PT can vary between 165 and 370 \xb0C, and the d 33 can vary between 373 and 505 pC/N. For PMN-PT based materials, the selection of end elements has a great influence on the performance. Among all relaxor ferroelectric, Pb(Sc1/2Nb1/2)O3 (PSN) is a typical material with a rhombohedral phase structure and its T c is about 90 \xb0C. The Rhombohedral-Tetragonal MPB of PSN-PT binary system had been successfully constructed near 42 mol% PT, at which high T c, piezoelectric and dielectric properties have been obtained. By combining the MPBs of PMN-PT and PSN-PT, a PSN-PMN-PT ternary system was developed by Yamashita et al. and the d 33 and T c reach 640 pC/N and 205 \xb0C, respectively, in 0.29PSN-0.34PMN-0.37PT composition , which are superior to the PMN-PT system. Recently, the improved thermal stability and piezoelectric performances of PSN-PMN-PT through composition design, ion doping and composite method. As reported by Guo et al., the d 33 and T c of 0.43PSN-0.17PMN-0.40PT composition are 650 pC/N and 255 \xb0C, respectively, in the meantime, the variation rate of d 33 remains below 20 % within a temperature range of 30 \u2013 250 \xb0C. Dong et al. conducted an investigation on 0.15PSN-(0.85 \u2212 x)PMN-xPT ceramics doped with 2 mol% SmE^{3 +}, finding that the d 33 reaches 815 pC/N when x = 0.33, and the d 33 varies by only 8 % over the test temperature range of 30 \u2212 110 \xb0C. Guo et al. noted that the composite ceramic of 0.15PSN-0.51PMN-0.34PT/0.05 mol ZnO exhibits an improved d 33 (590 pC/N) compared to pure 0.15PSN-0.51PMN-0.34PT (d 33 = 529 pC/N), and after annealing at 200 \xb0C, the retained d 33 maintains 92 % of the value before annealing. The results above mentioned show that PSN-PMN-PT system has great potential for practical applications. These questions are essential to comprehend the physical principles underlying the excellent performance of this system, which are very critical for the further development of PSN-PMN-PT solid solution as well as the component design for other ternary systems. In this study, the ternary xPSN-(1 \u2212 x \u2212 y)PMN-yPT (x = 0.06 \u2212 0.43, y = 0.32 \u2212 0.42) ceramics with different phase structures (rhombohedral, tetragonal and monoclinic phases) were established via the linear combination rule, as shown in. The phase structure, electrical properties and thermal stability of PSN-PMN-PT ceramics were analyzed in detail. Furthermore, to evaluate the potential in applications, an ultrasonic transducer with a center frequency (f c) of 4.65 MHz was fabricated using PSN-PMN-PT ceramic as an active element and the \u22126 dB bandwidth (BW) and two-way insertion loss (IL) were measured.

# CONCLUSION
In summary, xPSN-(1 \u2212 x \u2212 y)PMN-yPT (x = 0.06 \u2212 0.43, y = 0.32 \u2212 0.42) ceramics were fabricated with different phase structure. The consequences revealed that as the PT content rises, the ceramics with identical PSN content demonstrate a phase transition sequence of MC + R \u2192 MC + MA + R \u2192 MC + T. Meanwhile, as the PSN content increases, the MPB compositions exhibit a shift toward higher PT content. The maximum d 33 value for each x is obtained at 0.06PSN-0.59PMN-0.35PT, 0.15PSN-0.48PMN-0.37PT, 0.29PSN-0.32PMN-0.39PT and 0.43PSN-0.17PMN-0.40PT ceramics, in which both T and MC phases coexist but the T phase is dominant, and the corresponding value is 665, 620, 585, and 650 pC/N, respectively. The d 33 variation rates of these ceramics, ranging from room temperature to the T d of each ceramic, are 13 %, 7 %, 5 %, and 15 %, respectively, indicating that these ceramics have a good thermal stability. Moreover, the ultrasonic transducer (f c \u223c 4.69 MHz) was prepared using the 0.06PSN-0.59PMN-0.35PT ceramic with the highest d 33 as an active element. The \u22126 dB bandwidth is 77.4 % and two-way insertion loss is \u221221.45 dB. The findings of this study have guiding significance for the advancement of high-performance PT-based ferroelectric ceramics.

**Notes**:
- Write complete chemical formulas (e.g. '(Use the abbreviation key-value pair to track the abbreviations while extracting composition-property keywords). Don't use abbreviations, but you can use different environment if multiple compositions have different d33 values in different environments. For e.g.: 'LiNbO3-Air' and 'LiNbO3-Vacuum'.
- If multiple compositions are mentioned with different d33 values, extract all compositions mentioning different type/environment with a '-' and coreresponding d33 values.
- Mos of the formula are provided in ABSTRACT or INTRODUCTION or first part of EXPERIMENTAL SYNTHESIS.
- Use element symbols (e.g. 'K' not 'Potassium')
- For compositions with variables:
   * If multiple d33 values exist: Extract all compositions by substituting each variable value
   * If single d33 value: Extract only the best composition
- Prioritize data from tables
- Preserve proper chemical notation including:
   * Subscripts for atom counts
   * Parentheses for grouped elements
   * Proper fraction formatting
- Include the measurement unit for d33 values (usually pC/N or pm/V)
- Identify the broader family/class of materials - can be abbreviated forms
- Include if there is any doping in the composition using '+' sign with the composition, e.g. 'LiNbO3 + 2%wt Mg'
- Don't remove brackets or parentheses from the chemical formula which is already in the composition. Also, sometimes fractions are written before the composition (mostly in ()) for composition mixtures, don't remove them.
- Don't modify the abbreviation from referenced papers unless full composition is not available.
- ALWAYS follow the asked JSON format. DON'T write any extra information such as note points or explanations.
