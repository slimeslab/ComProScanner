# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
(a) shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of the 0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT textured ceramics sintered at 1250 \xb0C holding for different times. When the duration of holding time was increased from 0 to 9 h, the intensities of {00l}C diffraction peaks increase continuously but other peaks gradually decrease, demonstrating the enhanced crystal orientation along <00l>C direction. Corresponding Lotgering factor F 001 and piezoelectric coefficient d 33 also increase as depicted in (b). The F 001 and d 33 reach 95% and 675 pC/N, respectively, when the holding time is 9 h. With the holding time further increasing to 11 h, the F 001 remains a constant of 95% but the d 33 decreases to 660 pC/N. (c) and (d) show the X-ray diffraction patterns, F 001, and d 33 of 0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT textured ceramics sintered at different temperatures of 1200\u20131270 \xb0C for 9 h, respectively. The optimized d 33 of 718 pC/N is obtained at 1260 \xb0C and the F 001 is 95% in this case. The above-mentioned results indicate that excessive holding time and sintering temperature are not avail to achieve improved d 33 due to the increased volatilization of Pb. In the meantime, it can be concluded that the appropriate sintering process is 1260 \xb0C for 9 h for 0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT textured ceramics. To grasp the connection between texturing process and piezoelectric coefficient, the microstructures of 0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT textured ceramics fabricated at different holding times and sintering temperatures are detected. As presented in (a) and (b), the near ideal arrangement of BT templates along the <00l>C direction is observed in all samples. We can clearly see from (a) that when the holding times are relatively short (0\u20130.5 h), only a small amount of matrix grains nucleate and grow on the BT templates and the equiaxed 0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28 PT grains are dominant, leading to a low orientation degree (F 001 < 70%) and piezoelectric coefficient (d 33 < 300 pC/N). As the holding time extends to 6 h, most of the matrix grains grow along the BT templates and the proportion of oriented grains remarkably increases, but some randomly oriented grains remarked by yellow circles still remain. In this case, the F 001 of 92% and d 33 of 612 pC/N are achieved. When holding time extends to 9 h, almost no randomly oriented grains are visible in the ceramic, suggesting that a large proportion of the finer matrix grains are dissolved and utilized through the Ostwald ripening mechanism to nucleate and grow along the BT templates, resulting in enhanced F 001 of 95% and d 33 of 675 pC/N. With the further increasing holding time to 11 h, the ceramic is basically composed of oriented grains but both the count and dimension of pores increase, which is the reason for decreased d 33 and density. (b) shows the SEM images of the cross-section of textured ceramics sintered at different temperatures. Obviously, at 1200 \xb0C, the heteroepitaxial nucleation and growth of the matrix grains have taken place on the BT templates, but the momentum for the epitaxial growth of matrix grains far away from BT templates and ceramic densifying is still insufficient. The associated F 001 and d 33 are only 73% and 383 pC/N, respectively. With the rise in sintering temperature to 1260 \xb0C, the randomly oriented grains become invisible, manifesting that the driving force is enough to induce the majority of matrix grains to epitaxially grow along the BT templates and densify the ceramic. As a result, the F 001 increases to 95% and the maximum d 33 of 718 pC/N is acquired. When the sintering temperature further increases to 1270 \xb0C, it is found that there are large holes in the ceramic, corresponding to the rapid decline in density. Meanwhile, it should be noted that the BT templates exhibit traces of melting. In this case, the F 001 maintains at 95%, but the d 33 sharply decreases to 472 pC/N. (c) and (d) also illustrated how density varies with different holding times and sintering temperatures. Besides sintering temperature and holding time, the content of BT template is also a crucial factor in influencing the orientation degree and piezoelectric properties. (a) shows the XRD patterns of 0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT textured ceramics with different BT template contents sintered at 1260 \xb0C for 9 h. With the increase of template content, it can be clearly observed that the peak intensity of (110) decreases rapidly, while the peak intensities of (001) and (002) increase significantly and are positively correlated with the template content. (b) illustrates the variation of F 001 about different contents of the BT template. With the addition of template content from 1 vol% to 5 vol%, the F 001 exhibits a significant increase, rising from a minimum value of 81% to a maximum value of 96%. The evolution of the microstructure of 0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT ceramics with the increasing BT template content is presented in (c). In addition, it should be pointed out that the alignment of BT templates is well parallel with each other in all textured ceramics, which is a prerequisite for achieving a high F 001. As presented in (c), the randomly oriented 0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT ceramic is dominated by typical equiaxed grains, exhibiting a small average grain size of approximately 3 \u03bcm. When the content of BT template exceeds 2 vol%, the randomly oriented grains are barely visible, suggesting the texturing process accomplishes, which is in accord with XRD results. (a) illustrates the temperature dependence of dielectric constant \u03b5 r and dielectric loss tan\u03b4 for every ceramic gauged at a frequency of 1 kHz. The corresponding phase transition temperature T r-t and T c are about 120 \xb0C and 146 \xb0C, respectively. The following factors are responsible for this: (1) The introduction of tetragonal phase BT templates results in an increase in the volume fraction of tetragonal phase in 0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT textured ceramics. As a consequence, the R-T phase transition weakens and the \u03b5 r -T profile around T r-t flattens. (2) The heterogeneous BT templates existing in the 0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT textured ceramics can introduce the interfacial stress which pins the polarization rotation and results in a flat \u03b5 r-T profile around T r-t. Significantly, T c exhibits a decreasing trend with an increase in the BT template content, decreasing from 146 \xb0C at 0 vol% to 131 \xb0C at 5 vol%. The reason for this phenomenon can primarily be attributed to the low Curie temperature of the BT templates (T c \u223c 120 \xb0C). The dielectric constant \u03b5 r of the poled 0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT textured ceramics is listed in. The \u03b5 r increases from 1608 for randomly oriented ceramic to 2303 for textured ceramic with 3 vol% BT, increasing by 43%. Then, with an increase in BT content to 5 vol%, the \u03b5 r decreases to 2120, but it is still far greater than that of randomly oriented counterpart. The enhancement in \u03b5 r observed in textured ceramics is attributable to the establishment of the \u201c4R\u201d engineered domain structure, which favors the polarization rotation excited by an external electric field. However, because the dielectric constant of BT templates is too low, when a substantial quantity of BT templates is added to textured ceramic, it will result in a reduction of the dielectric constant. For 0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT textured ceramics with different BT contents, the dielectric loss tan\u03b4 fluctuates at 0.03, as presented in. Besides, the tan\u03b4 of all ceramics is observed to be less than 0.04 within the range of temperatures recorded, which is beneficial for practical applications. The broadening T-C phase transition peak indicates that the 0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT textured ceramics have a relaxor characteristic. The polar nanoregions (PNRs) contribute between 50% and 80% to the piezoelectric and dielectric properties of relaxor ferroelectric materials. Meanwhile, the PNRs are closest related to the relaxor behavior. Generally, the larger the volume fraction of PNRs, the stronger the relaxor behavior. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the source of the enhancement \u03b5 r in textured ceramics, the dielectric relaxor behavior is examined through the application of the modified Curie-Weiss law : where \u03b5 m denotes the maximum dielectric constant and T m refers to the corresponding temperature. Additionally, C represents the Curie-Weiss constant, and \u03b3 indicates the degree of relaxor behavior with values ranging from 1 to 2. The closer the \u03b3 value is to 2, the stronger the relaxor behavior is. The data illustrated in (b) indicates that all ceramics exhibit a linear relationship between ln(T-T m) and ln(1/\u03b5 r-1/\u03b5 m) and the \u03b3 value calculated by the slope of the fitting line. Clearly, the textured ceramics show a higher \u03b3 value in comparison to their randomly oriented counterpart (\u03b3 \u223c 1.75), which indicates that the relaxor behavior exhibited by textured ceramics is more pronounced. The reason for the increased relaxor behavior in textured ceramics may be that the interfacial stresses between BT template and oriented grain break the long-range ordered structure and increase the disorder of the lattice. While the competing of local polar order-disorder can lead to a flattening of the free-energy profile , thereby the dielectric constant \u03b5 r promotes for textured ceramics. For all textured ceramics, the \u03b3 value exhibits a trend of initially rising and subsequently declining as the BT template content increases. The maximum \u03b3 of 1.92 is obtained in 0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT with 3 vol% BT, as a result, the maximum \u03b5 r is also achieved in this ceramic. (a) illustrates the (P-E) hysteresis loops of the 0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT textured ceramics with different template contents measured at room temperature under an electric field of 20 kV/cm. The result shows that the P r in textured ceramics generally falls below that in randomly oriented ceramic (P r \u223c 31.1 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}). Meanwhile, as the template content escalated from 1 vol% BT to 5 vol% BT, the P r gradually decreased from 24.8 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} to 19.3 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}. These two phenomena can be attributed to two reasons:(1) For 0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT ceramic with rhombohedral phase, its spontaneous polarization is along the <111>c directions. The P r value along the non-polar <001>c direction only equals 1/\u221a3 of the value along the <111>c directions, due to the angle \u03b8 between [001]C (direction of the electric field) and [111]C is \u223c54.7\xb0. The larger the average \u03b8, the lower the P r value for ceramics with a rhombohedral phase. Compared with randomly oriented 0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT ceramic, the average \u03b8 of the textured counterpart is large. In addition, the average \u03b8 increases with the increased F 001, which is the reason for the reduced P r with the increasing BT content. (2) Because the P r value of BT templates is only \u223c 12 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}, which is significantly less than the PSN-PMN-PT matrix, the P r of 0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT textured ceramics decreases as the BT template content rises. Besides, it is found that the coercive field E c of the 0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT textured ceramics shows minimal variation when contrasted with randomly oriented ceramic and it fluctuates between 3.74 and 3.98 kV/cm. (c) displays the bipolar strain (S-E) curves of 0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT ceramic samples with different template contents gauged in the presence of a 20 kV/cm electric field. It is clearly observable that as the content of the BT template increases, the S Pos first increases and then decreases, while the S Neg gradually decreases. Correspondingly, the S Tol presents a pattern of initially rising followed by falling, and the highest value of about 0.255% is gained when the template content is 3 vol%, which surpasses the randomly oriented ceramic (0.211%). The enhancement of S Tol for textured ceramic is mainly derived from the increase in S Pos instead of S Neg, demonstrating that the contribution of polarization rotation is greater than that of non-180\xb0 ferroelastic domain switching. To understand the influence of template content on the piezoelectric properties, the quasi-static piezoelectric coefficient d 33, electromechanical coupling coefficient k p and mechanical quality factor Q m of the 0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT textured ceramics with the different template contents were tested, as shown in (a). The figure illustrates that with the rise in template content, the d 33 and k p rise initially and decrease afterwards. The d 33 and k p of randomly oriented ceramic are only 320 pC/N and 0.51, respectively, and when the template content is 3 vol%, the d 33 and k p increase to 718 pC/N and 0.73, respectively. The d 33 of the textured ceramic is 124% higher than that of the randomly oriented ceramic. The enhanced piezoelectric properties are mainly due to the piezoelectric anisotropy resulting from the high [001]c preferred orientation (F 001 = 95%) and the advantageous construction of the \u201c4R\u201d engineering domains. In addition, with the augmentation of template content to 5 vol%, the d 33 decreased slightly compared with 3 vol% BT, mainly because the piezoelectric property of BT templates is low (\u223c200 pC/N). These results manifest the addition of excessive BT templates negatively impacting the electric properties of the textured ceramics. The minimum value of 128 was obtained in a textured ceramic of 3 vol% BT. Generally speaking, a higher d 33 results from the easy domains switching and domain walls movement, which is always accompanied by more heater generation, resulting in lower Q m. (b) shows the variation of g 33 and d 33\xd7g 33 of 0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT textured ceramics with different BT contents. With the increase of template content, g 33 and d 33\xd7g 33 showed a trend of first increasing and then decreasing. The maximum value of g 33 at 3 vol% BT is 35.2\xd710E^{\u22123} mE^{2}/C. The maximum value of d 33\xd7g 33 at 3 vol% BT is 25.3\xd710E^{\u221212} mE^{2}/N, which is 3.5 times that of randomly oriented ceramic (7.2\xd710E^{\u221212} mE^{2}/N). They are related to d 33 and \u03b5 r. Because d 33 and \u03b5 r reach their maximum value when BT content is 3 vol%, g 33 and d 33\xd7g 33 reach their maximum value here. (c) and (d) show the unipolar strain (S-E) curves and corresponding maximum strain S max and large-signal piezoelectric constant d 33\u2217 of 0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT textured ceramics with different BT content gauged at 20 kV/cm. Clearly, a trend of variation for S max and d 33\u2217 closely resembles that of d 33 as the BT content increases. The maximum S max of 0.167% and d 33\u2217 of 835 pm/V at 20 kV/cm are also obtained at 0.15PSN-0.27PMN-0.28PT ceramic with 3 vol% BT. For further evaluation of the thermal depolarization property of the 0.15PSN-0.27PMN-0.28PT textured ceramic with 3 vol% BT and randomly oriented ceramic, the piezoelectric constant d 33 is tested at room temperature after being annealed at different temperatures for 30 min. shows the relationship between d 33 and annealing temperature. It can be seen that when the annealing temperature is 120 \xb0C, the d 33 of the textured and randomly oriented ceramic are 647 pC/N and 284 pC/N, respectively, maintaining 90% and 88% of the value at room temperature. It should be pointed out that the T c of the textured ceramic decreases compared to the randomly oriented counterpart, but temperature stability is better, which is primarily attributed to the enhanced tetragonal phase and the clamping effect of BT templates on polarization.

# TITLE
Microstructure and electric properties in PSN-PMN-PT textured ceramics by template grain growth technology

# ABSTRACT
In this work, the ternary 0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT ceramics were prepared by the template grain growth (TGG) technique, with BaTiO3 (BT) serving as the templates, and the effects of the holding time, sintering temperature and template content on microstructure and piezoelectric properties were investigated. It is found that the driving force is enough to induce the majority of matrix grains to epitaxially grow along the BT templates and densify the ceramics when the sintering temperature and holding time are 1260 °C and 9 h. In the meantime, the template content is positively correlated with Lotgering factor F

# INTRODUCTION
Among all piezoelectric materials, the binary perovskite ferroelectric materials represented by PMN-PT exhibit notable piezoelectric properties in proximity to the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB). To enhance the temperature stability of Pb-based relaxor ferroelectric materials, introducing components with high T c into binary solid solutions represents the most effective strategy, such as Pb(In1/2Nb1/2)O3 (PIN), Pb(Yb1/2Nb1/2)O3 (PYN), Pb(Sc1/2Nb1/2)O3 (PSN), PbZrO3 (PZ) and so on. For example, the T r-t and T c of PYN-PMN-PT system increase by more than 40 \xb0C compared with the binary PMN-PT system. The enhancement of T r-t and T c of PIN-PMN-PT exceeds 30 \xb0C when compared to the PMN-PT system. Take PSN-PMN-PT system as an example, the 0.06PSN-0.61PMN-0.33PT single crystal poled along [001]c exhibits d 33 of \u223c2630 pC/N, which is 4.6 times as that of its ceramic counterpart (d 33 \u223c 570 pC/N). Therefore, how to enhance the piezoelectric properties of ternary PT-based ceramics becomes very crucial. The component adjustment aims to construct the MPB at which the ceramics can obtain high piezoelectric performance. Ion doping, particularly the incorporation of rare earth ions, can dramatically enhance the piezoelectric properties of PT-based ceramics by introducing the local heterostructure. For example, a high piezoelectric constant d 33 (910 pC/N) is obtained in Sm-doped 0.40PMN-0.248PZ-0.352PT ceramic, increasing by nearly 40 % compared with undoped counterpart, but the T c drops by 46 \xb0C. Bai et al. doped Eu2O3 in 0.15PSN-0.52PMN-0.33PT ceramics, and the results show that d 33 (\u223c859 pC/N) increased by nearly 78% and T c decreased by 33 \xb0C after doping. Researchers have successfully prepared many high-performance textured ceramics using the template grain growth (TGG) technology. Yang fabricated 0.19PIN-0.445PSN-0.365PT textured ceramic featuring a 99.2% Lotgering factor F 001, and obtained high electric properties (d 33 \u223c 1100 pC/N, T c \u223c 247 \xb0C) when the BT template content is 5 vol%. Contrasted with randomly oriented ceramic of identical composition, the d 33 enhances by 3.6 times, and the T c only decreases by 15 \xb0C. Wei et al. fabricated the 0.36PIN-0.30PMN-0.34PT textured ceramics and found that the d 33 (\u223c780 pC/N) is almost twice as high as that of randomly oriented ceramic with the same component, and T c only decreases by 15 \xb0C. These results show that texturization stands as a more economical way to enhance the piezoelectric performance of ternary PT-based piezoelectric ceramics. It is known from previous reports that excellent piezoelectric properties and good temperature stability have been exhibited in PSN-PMN-PT ceramics and single crystals. In particular, by changing the sintering aids, it was found that the PSN-PMN-PT textured ceramic can get higher d 33 (\u223c1030 pC/N) and maintain good temperature stability at 25\u2013140 \xb0C. In this work, the 0.15Pb(Sc1/2Nb1/2)O3-0.57Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.28PbTiO3 (0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT) composition with rhombohedral phase structure was chosen as the ceramic matrix and the BaTiO3 (BT) sheets served as templates for the fabrication of textured ceramics through template grain growth technology. It is expected that the improved piezoelectric properties can be achieved in the 0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT textured ceramics.

# CONCLUSION
In summary, the template grain growth technique was employed to prepare PSN-PMN-PT textured ceramics utilizing BT as the template. The results show that with the increase of template content, the F 001 keeps increasing, but d 33, \u03b5 r, k p and S max increase first and then decrease. When the template content is 3 vol%, the higher F 001 (95%) and the optimized comprehensive performance are obtained. The corresponding d 33, d 33\u2217, \u03b5 r, k p , T c S max, g 33 and g 33\xd7d 33 are 718 pC/N, 835 pm/V, 2303, 0.73, 133 \xb0C, 0.167%, 35.2\xd710E^{\u22123} mE^{2}/C and 25.3\xd710E^{\u221212} mE^{2}/N. In the meantime, when the annealed temperature increases from 30 to 120 \xb0C, the d 33 of this ceramic only decreases by 10%, manifesting good temperature stability. These outcomes reveal that the PSN-PMN-PT textured ceramics have a bright application prospect in advanced electronic devices.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
(a) shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of the 0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT textured ceramics sintered at 1250 \xb0C holding for different times. When the duration of holding time was increased from 0 to 9 h, the intensities of {00l}C diffraction peaks increase continuously but other peaks gradually decrease, demonstrating the enhanced crystal orientation along <00l>C direction. Corresponding Lotgering factor F 001 and piezoelectric coefficient d 33 also increase as depicted in (b). The F 001 and d 33 reach 95% and 675 pC/N, respectively, when the holding time is 9 h. With the holding time further increasing to 11 h, the F 001 remains a constant of 95% but the d 33 decreases to 660 pC/N. (c) and (d) show the X-ray diffraction patterns, F 001, and d 33 of 0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT textured ceramics sintered at different temperatures of 1200\u20131270 \xb0C for 9 h, respectively. The optimized d 33 of 718 pC/N is obtained at 1260 \xb0C and the F 001 is 95% in this case. The above-mentioned results indicate that excessive holding time and sintering temperature are not avail to achieve improved d 33 due to the increased volatilization of Pb. In the meantime, it can be concluded that the appropriate sintering process is 1260 \xb0C for 9 h for 0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT textured ceramics. To grasp the connection between texturing process and piezoelectric coefficient, the microstructures of 0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT textured ceramics fabricated at different holding times and sintering temperatures are detected. As presented in (a) and (b), the near ideal arrangement of BT templates along the <00l>C direction is observed in all samples. We can clearly see from (a) that when the holding times are relatively short (0\u20130.5 h), only a small amount of matrix grains nucleate and grow on the BT templates and the equiaxed 0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28 PT grains are dominant, leading to a low orientation degree (F 001 < 70%) and piezoelectric coefficient (d 33 < 300 pC/N). As the holding time extends to 6 h, most of the matrix grains grow along the BT templates and the proportion of oriented grains remarkably increases, but some randomly oriented grains remarked by yellow circles still remain. In this case, the F 001 of 92% and d 33 of 612 pC/N are achieved. When holding time extends to 9 h, almost no randomly oriented grains are visible in the ceramic, suggesting that a large proportion of the finer matrix grains are dissolved and utilized through the Ostwald ripening mechanism to nucleate and grow along the BT templates, resulting in enhanced F 001 of 95% and d 33 of 675 pC/N. With the further increasing holding time to 11 h, the ceramic is basically composed of oriented grains but both the count and dimension of pores increase, which is the reason for decreased d 33 and density. (b) shows the SEM images of the cross-section of textured ceramics sintered at different temperatures. Obviously, at 1200 \xb0C, the heteroepitaxial nucleation and growth of the matrix grains have taken place on the BT templates, but the momentum for the epitaxial growth of matrix grains far away from BT templates and ceramic densifying is still insufficient. The associated F 001 and d 33 are only 73% and 383 pC/N, respectively. With the rise in sintering temperature to 1260 \xb0C, the randomly oriented grains become invisible, manifesting that the driving force is enough to induce the majority of matrix grains to epitaxially grow along the BT templates and densify the ceramic. As a result, the F 001 increases to 95% and the maximum d 33 of 718 pC/N is acquired. When the sintering temperature further increases to 1270 \xb0C, it is found that there are large holes in the ceramic, corresponding to the rapid decline in density. Meanwhile, it should be noted that the BT templates exhibit traces of melting. In this case, the F 001 maintains at 95%, but the d 33 sharply decreases to 472 pC/N. (c) and (d) also illustrated how density varies with different holding times and sintering temperatures. Besides sintering temperature and holding time, the content of BT template is also a crucial factor in influencing the orientation degree and piezoelectric properties. (a) shows the XRD patterns of 0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT textured ceramics with different BT template contents sintered at 1260 \xb0C for 9 h. With the increase of template content, it can be clearly observed that the peak intensity of (110) decreases rapidly, while the peak intensities of (001) and (002) increase significantly and are positively correlated with the template content. (b) illustrates the variation of F 001 about different contents of the BT template. With the addition of template content from 1 vol% to 5 vol%, the F 001 exhibits a significant increase, rising from a minimum value of 81% to a maximum value of 96%. The evolution of the microstructure of 0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT ceramics with the increasing BT template content is presented in (c). In addition, it should be pointed out that the alignment of BT templates is well parallel with each other in all textured ceramics, which is a prerequisite for achieving a high F 001. As presented in (c), the randomly oriented 0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT ceramic is dominated by typical equiaxed grains, exhibiting a small average grain size of approximately 3 \u03bcm. When the content of BT template exceeds 2 vol%, the randomly oriented grains are barely visible, suggesting the texturing process accomplishes, which is in accord with XRD results. (a) illustrates the temperature dependence of dielectric constant \u03b5 r and dielectric loss tan\u03b4 for every ceramic gauged at a frequency of 1 kHz. The corresponding phase transition temperature T r-t and T c are about 120 \xb0C and 146 \xb0C, respectively. The following factors are responsible for this: (1) The introduction of tetragonal phase BT templates results in an increase in the volume fraction of tetragonal phase in 0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT textured ceramics. As a consequence, the R-T phase transition weakens and the \u03b5 r -T profile around T r-t flattens. (2) The heterogeneous BT templates existing in the 0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT textured ceramics can introduce the interfacial stress which pins the polarization rotation and results in a flat \u03b5 r-T profile around T r-t. Significantly, T c exhibits a decreasing trend with an increase in the BT template content, decreasing from 146 \xb0C at 0 vol% to 131 \xb0C at 5 vol%. The reason for this phenomenon can primarily be attributed to the low Curie temperature of the BT templates (T c \u223c 120 \xb0C). The dielectric constant \u03b5 r of the poled 0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT textured ceramics is listed in. The \u03b5 r increases from 1608 for randomly oriented ceramic to 2303 for textured ceramic with 3 vol% BT, increasing by 43%. Then, with an increase in BT content to 5 vol%, the \u03b5 r decreases to 2120, but it is still far greater than that of randomly oriented counterpart. The enhancement in \u03b5 r observed in textured ceramics is attributable to the establishment of the \u201c4R\u201d engineered domain structure, which favors the polarization rotation excited by an external electric field. However, because the dielectric constant of BT templates is too low, when a substantial quantity of BT templates is added to textured ceramic, it will result in a reduction of the dielectric constant. For 0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT textured ceramics with different BT contents, the dielectric loss tan\u03b4 fluctuates at 0.03, as presented in. Besides, the tan\u03b4 of all ceramics is observed to be less than 0.04 within the range of temperatures recorded, which is beneficial for practical applications. The broadening T-C phase transition peak indicates that the 0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT textured ceramics have a relaxor characteristic. The polar nanoregions (PNRs) contribute between 50% and 80% to the piezoelectric and dielectric properties of relaxor ferroelectric materials. Meanwhile, the PNRs are closest related to the relaxor behavior. Generally, the larger the volume fraction of PNRs, the stronger the relaxor behavior. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the source of the enhancement \u03b5 r in textured ceramics, the dielectric relaxor behavior is examined through the application of the modified Curie-Weiss law : where \u03b5 m denotes the maximum dielectric constant and T m refers to the corresponding temperature. Additionally, C represents the Curie-Weiss constant, and \u03b3 indicates the degree of relaxor behavior with values ranging from 1 to 2. The closer the \u03b3 value is to 2, the stronger the relaxor behavior is. The data illustrated in (b) indicates that all ceramics exhibit a linear relationship between ln(T-T m) and ln(1/\u03b5 r-1/\u03b5 m) and the \u03b3 value calculated by the slope of the fitting line. Clearly, the textured ceramics show a higher \u03b3 value in comparison to their randomly oriented counterpart (\u03b3 \u223c 1.75), which indicates that the relaxor behavior exhibited by textured ceramics is more pronounced. The reason for the increased relaxor behavior in textured ceramics may be that the interfacial stresses between BT template and oriented grain break the long-range ordered structure and increase the disorder of the lattice. While the competing of local polar order-disorder can lead to a flattening of the free-energy profile , thereby the dielectric constant \u03b5 r promotes for textured ceramics. For all textured ceramics, the \u03b3 value exhibits a trend of initially rising and subsequently declining as the BT template content increases. The maximum \u03b3 of 1.92 is obtained in 0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT with 3 vol% BT, as a result, the maximum \u03b5 r is also achieved in this ceramic. (a) illustrates the (P-E) hysteresis loops of the 0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT textured ceramics with different template contents measured at room temperature under an electric field of 20 kV/cm. The result shows that the P r in textured ceramics generally falls below that in randomly oriented ceramic (P r \u223c 31.1 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}). Meanwhile, as the template content escalated from 1 vol% BT to 5 vol% BT, the P r gradually decreased from 24.8 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} to 19.3 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}. These two phenomena can be attributed to two reasons:(1) For 0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT ceramic with rhombohedral phase, its spontaneous polarization is along the <111>c directions. The P r value along the non-polar <001>c direction only equals 1/\u221a3 of the value along the <111>c directions, due to the angle \u03b8 between [001]C (direction of the electric field) and [111]C is \u223c54.7\xb0. The larger the average \u03b8, the lower the P r value for ceramics with a rhombohedral phase. Compared with randomly oriented 0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT ceramic, the average \u03b8 of the textured counterpart is large. In addition, the average \u03b8 increases with the increased F 001, which is the reason for the reduced P r with the increasing BT content. (2) Because the P r value of BT templates is only \u223c 12 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}, which is significantly less than the PSN-PMN-PT matrix, the P r of 0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT textured ceramics decreases as the BT template content rises. Besides, it is found that the coercive field E c of the 0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT textured ceramics shows minimal variation when contrasted with randomly oriented ceramic and it fluctuates between 3.74 and 3.98 kV/cm. (c) displays the bipolar strain (S-E) curves of 0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT ceramic samples with different template contents gauged in the presence of a 20 kV/cm electric field. It is clearly observable that as the content of the BT template increases, the S Pos first increases and then decreases, while the S Neg gradually decreases. Correspondingly, the S Tol presents a pattern of initially rising followed by falling, and the highest value of about 0.255% is gained when the template content is 3 vol%, which surpasses the randomly oriented ceramic (0.211%). The enhancement of S Tol for textured ceramic is mainly derived from the increase in S Pos instead of S Neg, demonstrating that the contribution of polarization rotation is greater than that of non-180\xb0 ferroelastic domain switching. To understand the influence of template content on the piezoelectric properties, the quasi-static piezoelectric coefficient d 33, electromechanical coupling coefficient k p and mechanical quality factor Q m of the 0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT textured ceramics with the different template contents were tested, as shown in (a). The figure illustrates that with the rise in template content, the d 33 and k p rise initially and decrease afterwards. The d 33 and k p of randomly oriented ceramic are only 320 pC/N and 0.51, respectively, and when the template content is 3 vol%, the d 33 and k p increase to 718 pC/N and 0.73, respectively. The d 33 of the textured ceramic is 124% higher than that of the randomly oriented ceramic. The enhanced piezoelectric properties are mainly due to the piezoelectric anisotropy resulting from the high [001]c preferred orientation (F 001 = 95%) and the advantageous construction of the \u201c4R\u201d engineering domains. In addition, with the augmentation of template content to 5 vol%, the d 33 decreased slightly compared with 3 vol% BT, mainly because the piezoelectric property of BT templates is low (\u223c200 pC/N). These results manifest the addition of excessive BT templates negatively impacting the electric properties of the textured ceramics. The minimum value of 128 was obtained in a textured ceramic of 3 vol% BT. Generally speaking, a higher d 33 results from the easy domains switching and domain walls movement, which is always accompanied by more heater generation, resulting in lower Q m. (b) shows the variation of g 33 and d 33\xd7g 33 of 0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT textured ceramics with different BT contents. With the increase of template content, g 33 and d 33\xd7g 33 showed a trend of first increasing and then decreasing. The maximum value of g 33 at 3 vol% BT is 35.2\xd710E^{\u22123} mE^{2}/C. The maximum value of d 33\xd7g 33 at 3 vol% BT is 25.3\xd710E^{\u221212} mE^{2}/N, which is 3.5 times that of randomly oriented ceramic (7.2\xd710E^{\u221212} mE^{2}/N). They are related to d 33 and \u03b5 r. Because d 33 and \u03b5 r reach their maximum value when BT content is 3 vol%, g 33 and d 33\xd7g 33 reach their maximum value here. (c) and (d) show the unipolar strain (S-E) curves and corresponding maximum strain S max and large-signal piezoelectric constant d 33\u2217 of 0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT textured ceramics with different BT content gauged at 20 kV/cm. Clearly, a trend of variation for S max and d 33\u2217 closely resembles that of d 33 as the BT content increases. The maximum S max of 0.167% and d 33\u2217 of 835 pm/V at 20 kV/cm are also obtained at 0.15PSN-0.27PMN-0.28PT ceramic with 3 vol% BT. For further evaluation of the thermal depolarization property of the 0.15PSN-0.27PMN-0.28PT textured ceramic with 3 vol% BT and randomly oriented ceramic, the piezoelectric constant d 33 is tested at room temperature after being annealed at different temperatures for 30 min. shows the relationship between d 33 and annealing temperature. It can be seen that when the annealing temperature is 120 \xb0C, the d 33 of the textured and randomly oriented ceramic are 647 pC/N and 284 pC/N, respectively, maintaining 90% and 88% of the value at room temperature. It should be pointed out that the T c of the textured ceramic decreases compared to the randomly oriented counterpart, but temperature stability is better, which is primarily attributed to the enhanced tetragonal phase and the clamping effect of BT templates on polarization.

# TITLE
Microstructure and electric properties in PSN-PMN-PT textured ceramics by template grain growth technology

# ABSTRACT
In this work, the ternary 0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT ceramics were prepared by the template grain growth (TGG) technique, with BaTiO3 (BT) serving as the templates, and the effects of the holding time, sintering temperature and template content on microstructure and piezoelectric properties were investigated. It is found that the driving force is enough to induce the majority of matrix grains to epitaxially grow along the BT templates and densify the ceramics when the sintering temperature and holding time are 1260 °C and 9 h. In the meantime, the template content is positively correlated with Lotgering factor F

# INTRODUCTION
Among all piezoelectric materials, the binary perovskite ferroelectric materials represented by PMN-PT exhibit notable piezoelectric properties in proximity to the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB). To enhance the temperature stability of Pb-based relaxor ferroelectric materials, introducing components with high T c into binary solid solutions represents the most effective strategy, such as Pb(In1/2Nb1/2)O3 (PIN), Pb(Yb1/2Nb1/2)O3 (PYN), Pb(Sc1/2Nb1/2)O3 (PSN), PbZrO3 (PZ) and so on. For example, the T r-t and T c of PYN-PMN-PT system increase by more than 40 \xb0C compared with the binary PMN-PT system. The enhancement of T r-t and T c of PIN-PMN-PT exceeds 30 \xb0C when compared to the PMN-PT system. Take PSN-PMN-PT system as an example, the 0.06PSN-0.61PMN-0.33PT single crystal poled along [001]c exhibits d 33 of \u223c2630 pC/N, which is 4.6 times as that of its ceramic counterpart (d 33 \u223c 570 pC/N). Therefore, how to enhance the piezoelectric properties of ternary PT-based ceramics becomes very crucial. The component adjustment aims to construct the MPB at which the ceramics can obtain high piezoelectric performance. Ion doping, particularly the incorporation of rare earth ions, can dramatically enhance the piezoelectric properties of PT-based ceramics by introducing the local heterostructure. For example, a high piezoelectric constant d 33 (910 pC/N) is obtained in Sm-doped 0.40PMN-0.248PZ-0.352PT ceramic, increasing by nearly 40 % compared with undoped counterpart, but the T c drops by 46 \xb0C. Bai et al. doped Eu2O3 in 0.15PSN-0.52PMN-0.33PT ceramics, and the results show that d 33 (\u223c859 pC/N) increased by nearly 78% and T c decreased by 33 \xb0C after doping. Researchers have successfully prepared many high-performance textured ceramics using the template grain growth (TGG) technology. Yang fabricated 0.19PIN-0.445PSN-0.365PT textured ceramic featuring a 99.2% Lotgering factor F 001, and obtained high electric properties (d 33 \u223c 1100 pC/N, T c \u223c 247 \xb0C) when the BT template content is 5 vol%. Contrasted with randomly oriented ceramic of identical composition, the d 33 enhances by 3.6 times, and the T c only decreases by 15 \xb0C. Wei et al. fabricated the 0.36PIN-0.30PMN-0.34PT textured ceramics and found that the d 33 (\u223c780 pC/N) is almost twice as high as that of randomly oriented ceramic with the same component, and T c only decreases by 15 \xb0C. These results show that texturization stands as a more economical way to enhance the piezoelectric performance of ternary PT-based piezoelectric ceramics. It is known from previous reports that excellent piezoelectric properties and good temperature stability have been exhibited in PSN-PMN-PT ceramics and single crystals. In particular, by changing the sintering aids, it was found that the PSN-PMN-PT textured ceramic can get higher d 33 (\u223c1030 pC/N) and maintain good temperature stability at 25\u2013140 \xb0C. In this work, the 0.15Pb(Sc1/2Nb1/2)O3-0.57Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.28PbTiO3 (0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT) composition with rhombohedral phase structure was chosen as the ceramic matrix and the BaTiO3 (BT) sheets served as templates for the fabrication of textured ceramics through template grain growth technology. It is expected that the improved piezoelectric properties can be achieved in the 0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT textured ceramics.

# CONCLUSION
In summary, the template grain growth technique was employed to prepare PSN-PMN-PT textured ceramics utilizing BT as the template. The results show that with the increase of template content, the F 001 keeps increasing, but d 33, \u03b5 r, k p and S max increase first and then decrease. When the template content is 3 vol%, the higher F 001 (95%) and the optimized comprehensive performance are obtained. The corresponding d 33, d 33\u2217, \u03b5 r, k p , T c S max, g 33 and g 33\xd7d 33 are 718 pC/N, 835 pm/V, 2303, 0.73, 133 \xb0C, 0.167%, 35.2\xd710E^{\u22123} mE^{2}/C and 25.3\xd710E^{\u221212} mE^{2}/N. In the meantime, when the annealed temperature increases from 30 to 120 \xb0C, the d 33 of this ceramic only decreases by 10%, manifesting good temperature stability. These outcomes reveal that the PSN-PMN-PT textured ceramics have a bright application prospect in advanced electronic devices.

- Mos of the formula are provided in ABSTRACT or INTRODUCTION or first part of EXPERIMENTAL SYNTHESIS.
- Use element symbols (e.g. 'K' not 'Potassium')
- For compositions with variables:
   * If multiple d33 values exist: Extract all compositions by substituting each variable value
   * If single d33 value: Extract only the best composition
- Prioritize data from tables
- Preserve proper chemical notation including:
   * Subscripts for atom counts
   * Parentheses for grouped elements
   * Proper fraction formatting
- Include the measurement unit for d33 values (usually pC/N or pm/V)
- Identify the broader family/class of materials - can be abbreviated forms
- Include if there is any doping in the composition using '+' sign with the composition, e.g. 'LiNbO3 + 2%wt Mg'
- Don't remove brackets or parentheses from the chemical formula which is already in the composition. Also, sometimes fractions are written before the composition (mostly in ()) for composition mixtures, don't remove them.
- Don't modify the abbreviation from referenced papers unless full composition is not available.
- ALWAYS follow the asked JSON format. DON'T write any extra information such as note points or explanations.
", agent="Material Composition and Property Extractor", status="completed", output="I need to extract the material compositions, their corresponding d33 values, the unit for d33, and the material family from the provided text. I will prioritize data from the table and then from the text, ensuring to use full chemical formulas and handle abbreviations and variable compositions as per the instructions.

Here's the plan:
1.  **Identify the main composition**: From the abstract and introduction, the main composition is "0.15Pb(Sc1/2Nb1/2)O3-0.57Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.28PbTiO3" which is also referred to as "0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT".
2.  **Identify the template material**: BaTiO3 (BT) is used as a template. The d33 values are given for "0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT textured ceramics with different BT template contents".
3.  **Extract d33 values and corresponding compositions from Table 1**:
    *   "BT content (vol%)" corresponds to the amount of BaTiO3 added to the 0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT ceramic.
    *   0 vol% BT: 0.15Pb(Sc1/2Nb1/2)O3-0.57Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.28PbTiO3 (randomly oriented ceramic) -> d33 = 320 pC/N
    *   1 vol% BT: 0.15Pb(Sc1/2Nb1/2)O3-0.57Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.28PbTiO3 + 1 vol% BaTiO3 -> d33 = 512 pC/N
    *   2 vol% BT: 0.15Pb(Sc1/2Nb1/2)O3-0.57Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.28PbTiO3 + 2 vol% BaTiO3 -> d33 = 585 pC/N
    *   3 vol% BT: 0.15Pb(Sc1/2Nb1/2)O3-0.57Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.28PbTiO3 + 3 vol% BaTiO3 -> d33 = 718 pC/N
    *   5 vol% BT: 0.15Pb(Sc1/2Nb1/2)O3-0.57Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.28PbTiO3 + 5 vol% BaTiO3 -> d33 = 614 pC/N
4.  **Extract d33 values from the text related to holding time and sintering temperature**:
    *   "0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT textured ceramics" sintered at 1250 °C for 9 h: d33 = 675 pC/N.
    *   "0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT textured ceramics" sintered at 1250 °C for 11 h: d33 = 660 pC/N.
    *   "0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT textured ceramics" sintered at 1260 °C for 9 h: d33 = 718 pC/N (optimized).
    *   "0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT textured ceramics" sintered at 1200 °C for 9 h: d33 = 383 pC/N.
    *   "0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT textured ceramics" sintered at 1270 °C for 9 h: d33 = 472 pC/N.
    *   "0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT textured ceramics" with 6h holding time: d33 = 612 pC/N.
    *   "0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT textured ceramics" with 0-0.5h holding time: d33 < 300 pC/N (not a specific value, so I will omit this one as per the instruction to extract specific values).
    *   "0.15PSN-0.27PMN-0.28PT ceramic with 3 vol% BT" (typo in text, should be 0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT) annealed at 120 °C: d33 = 647 pC/N.
    *   "randomly oriented ceramic" annealed at 120 °C: d33 = 284 pC/N.
5.  **Determine the property unit**: From Table 1, d33 is given in "pC/N".
6.  **Determine the family**: The materials are based on "PSN-PMN-PT" system, which falls under "PbTiO3" or "Perovskite" family. Given the specific components, "PSN-PMN-PT" is a good family name.
7.  **Handle abbreviations**: PSN, PMN, PT, BT, TGG.
    *   PSN: Pb(Sc1/2Nb1/2)O3
    *   PMN: Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3
    *   PT: PbTiO3
    *   BT: BaTiO3
    *   TGG: Template Grain Growth (This is a technique, not a material abbreviation, so it won't be included in the abbreviations for compositions).

Let's refine the compositions for clarity and consistency. The base composition is 0.15Pb(Sc1/2Nb1/2)O3-0.57Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.28PbTiO3. The "BT content (vol%)" indicates the addition of BaTiO3 templates.

For the compositions with different BT content, the base composition is 0.15Pb(Sc1/2Nb1/2)O3-0.57Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.28PbTiO3.
*   0 vol% BT: 0.15Pb(Sc1/2Nb1/2)O3-0.57Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.28PbTiO3
*   1 vol% BT: 0.15Pb(Sc1/2Nb1/2)O3-0.57Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.28PbTiO3 + 1 vol% BaTiO3
*   2 vol% BT: 0.15Pb(Sc1/2Nb1/2)O3-0.57Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.28PbTiO3 + 2 vol% BaTiO3
*   3 vol% BT: 0.15Pb(Sc1/2Nb1/2)O3-0.57Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.28PbTiO3 + 3 vol% BaTiO3
*   5 vol% BT: 0.15Pb(Sc1/2Nb1/2)O3-0.57Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.28PbTiO3 + 5 vol% BaTiO3

For the compositions with different sintering conditions, the composition is implicitly 0.15Pb(Sc1/2Nb1/2)O3-0.57Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.28PbTiO3 with some BT content (likely 3 vol% as it's the optimized one, but the text doesn't explicitly state the BT content for all sintering condition variations, only that they are "textured ceramics"). However, the table explicitly links BT content to d33. The text also mentions "0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT textured ceramics" for sintering studies. The abstract states "When the BT content is 3 vol%, the F001 reaches 95 % and the optimized comprehensive electric properties (d33 = 718 pC/N...)" which implies the sintering studies are likely on the 3 vol% BT composition unless stated otherwise.

Let's stick to the most explicit data. The table provides clear compositions with varying BT content and their d33 values. The text provides d33 values for the "0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT textured ceramics" under different processing conditions (holding time, sintering temperature). It's important to represent these as distinct entries if the processing condition changes the d33 value significantly.

The base composition is 0.15Pb(Sc1/2Nb1/2)O3-0.57Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.28PbTiO3.
Let's denote this as "Base Composition".

From Table 1:
*   Base Composition: 320
*   Base Composition + 1 vol% BaTiO3: 512
*   Base Composition + 2 vol% BaTiO3: 585
*   Base Composition + 3 vol% BaTiO3: 718
*   Base Composition + 5 vol% BaTiO3: 614

From text (sintering time and temperature effects on "0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT textured ceramics"):
The text states "The F 001 and d 33 reach 95% and 675 pC/N, respectively, when the holding time is 9 h." and "With the holding time further increasing to 11 h, the F 001 remains a constant of 95% but the d 33 decreases to 660 pC/N." and "The optimized d 33 of 718 pC/N is obtained at 1260 °C and the F 001 is 95% in this case."
It also mentions "d 33 of 612 pC/N are achieved" for 6h holding time, "d 33 are only 73% and 383 pC/N, respectively" for 1200 °C, and "d 33 sharply decreases to 472 pC/N" for 1270 °C.

The problem states "Only consider the article's own work data. Don't consider referenced paper's data." and "Prioritize data from tables".
The table clearly lists "BT content (vol%)" as a variable. The text then discusses the effect of holding time and sintering temperature on "0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT textured ceramics". It's reasonable to assume these are variations of the main composition with BT templates, as the paper is about "PSN-PMN-PT textured ceramics by template grain growth technology". The abstract explicitly states "When the BT content is 3 vol%, the F001 reaches 95 % and the optimized comprehensive electric properties (d33 = 718 pC/N...) are obtained." This suggests that the 718 pC/N value from the table for 3 vol% BT is the optimized one, and the sintering conditions mentioned (1260 °C for 9h) lead to this optimized value.

To avoid redundancy and follow the "prioritize data from tables" rule, I will use the compositions and d33 values directly from Table 1, as they represent the core variations studied in terms of template content. The text provides additional d33 values for specific processing conditions (holding time, sintering temperature) for the "0.15PSN-0.57PMN-0.28PT textured ceramics". It's important to represent these as distinct entries if the processing condition changes the d33 value significantly.

Let's list the compositions and their d33 values, making sure to include the processing conditions if they lead to a specific d33 value not directly tied to the BT content in the table.

The base composition is 0.15Pb(Sc1/2Nb1/2)O3-0.57Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.28PbTiO3.
Let's call this `Base_Composition`.

From Table 1 (varying BT content):
*   `Base_Composition`: 320 (This is the 0 vol% BT, randomly oriented ceramic)
*   `Base_Composition + 1 vol% BaTiO3`: 512
*   `Base_Composition + 2 vol% BaTiO3`: 585
*   `Base_Composition + 3 vol% BaTiO3`: 718
*   `Base_Composition + 5 vol% BaTiO3`: 614

From text (varying processing conditions for `Base_Composition` textured ceramics, likely with BT templates, but the exact BT content isn't always specified for each processing variation, except for the optimized one):
*   `Base_Composition textured ceramic - 9h holding time`: 675 (This is likely with 3 vol% BT, as 9h holding time and 1260C sintering are mentioned for the optimized 718 pC/N, but the 675 pC/N is specifically for 1250C and 9h holding time)
*   `Base_Composition textured ceramic - 11h holding time`: 660
*   `Base_Composition textured ceramic - 1260°C sintering`: 718 (This matches the 3 vol% BT from the table, so I will use the table entry for this specific value to avoid duplication and maintain consistency with the primary variable)
*   `Base_Composition textured ceramic - 1200°C sintering`: 383
*   `Base_Composition textured ceramic - 1270°C sintering`: 472
*   `Base_Composition textured ceramic - 6h holding time`: 612
*   `Base_Composition textured ceramic + 3 vol% BaTiO3 - annealed at 120°C`: 647 (This is a specific condition for the 3 vol% BT composition)
*   `Base_Composition - randomly oriented ceramic - annealed at 120°C`: 284 (This is for the 0 vol% BT composition)

I will list the compositions as clearly as possible, including the processing conditions where they lead to a distinct d33 value.

The family is "PSN-PMN-PT".
The unit is "pC/N".
