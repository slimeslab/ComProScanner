The commercial PZT ceramic discs of grade SP-6 with the Curie temperature of 380 \xb0C  were sourced from Sparkler Ceramics, Pune, India. Each disc was measured 20 mm in diameter and 2 \xb1 0.04 mm in thickness, with the parameters (average values) given in. Considering the longitudinal wave velocity of 4640 m/s and the \u03bb/2 criteria, where \u03bb is the wavelength in PZT, the given thickness of 2 \xb1 0.04 mm is suitable for generating longitudinal ultrasonic waves at frequencies around 1 MHz, instead of the ideal thickness of 2.3 mm. Both sides of the PZT discs were coated with silver using screen printing with a proprietary silver paste, free of glass frit, followed by firing at approximately 800\xb0C in air. The final silver coating thickness on each PZT disc was around 25 \u03bcm. The quality of the bond between the screen-printed silver electrodes and PZT discs was assessed using ultrasonic C-scan imaging (as detailed in ) and only those discs that met the required standards were used for further fabrication. The room temperature piezoelectric charge coefficient (d33) of the as-received PZT discs, as well as at various stages of bonding to the nickel wear plates and during thermal cycle experiments, was measured using Piezometer System (Model PM100, Piezotest, UK). The nickel wear plates, each 2 mm thick, were machined from Ni-200 rods. The surface of the wear plate was ground to achieve a planarity of approximately 10 \u03bcm and a roughness of about 1 \u03bcm. To prepare the surface for bonding, the Ni wear plate was first coated with silver using a DC sputtering process to a thickness of about 6 \u03bcm. This was followed by heating the coated surface in flowing hydrogen gas at 700 \xb0C for 2 h to facilitate the diffusion of silver into the nickel and establish a solid solution, thereby forming a strong metallurgical bond between the silver electrode and the nickel. An additional silver coating of about 3 \u03bcm thickness was then applied, bringing the overall thickness of Ag coating on the nickel wear plate to approximately 9 \u03bcm. Photographs of a PZT disc and the silver-coated nickel wear plate are shown in. The vessel\u2019s bottom features a 10 mm thick plate with a special slot for positioning a sample holder. This holder is made from three vertical 6 mm diameter rods and a thick base plate, designed to securely align and hold the nickel wear plate and PZT disc. The vessel has a port to connect to a vacuum system, allowing it to be evacuated to a high vacuum of less than -E^{10}E^{2} Pa. The vessel can be heated up to 700 \xb0C using a split furnace that surrounds it. A uniaxial press applies a predetermined pressure (up to 40 MPa) on the bonding components via this rod while maintaining the vacuum inside the vessel. Two different bonding temperatures were used: 275 \xb0C (below the Curie temperature, Tc, of PZT) and 400 \xb0C (above Tc). According to Fateri et al. , the tensile strength of silver is approximately 180 MPa at 275\xb0C and about 150 MPa at 400\xb0C. In our experiments, a bonding pressure of 20 MPa was used, which is well below the tensile strength of silver at the chosen temperatures, and the bonding duration was set to 1 h. In cases 1 & 2, the 1 \u03bcm thick silver coating was applied over the screen-printed silver layer on the PZT disc using DC magnetron sputtering. In cases 3 & 4, the screen-printed silver coating on the PZT disc was removed, and a \u223c 10 \u03bcm silver was applied. After each 3 \u03bcm layer of silver was deposited, the disc was heated to 800 \xb0C to ensure adhesion of the silver to the PZT disc. Initially, a load of approximately 1 MPa was applied to the components, followed by evacuation of the vessel to less than -E^{10}E^{2} Pa. The furnace was then put on, and once the desired temperature was reached, the final load of 20 MPa was applied. After maintaining the components under this pressure for 1 h, the furnace was turned off, and the vessel was allowed to cool to room temperature. The PZT discs that met the quality standards were subjected to thermal cycles between 250 \xb0C and room temperature in air. Each cycle involved heating the PZT disc bonded to the nickel wear plate to 250 \xb0C at a rate of 3 \xb0C per hour, holding at that temperature for 2 h, and then furnace cooling to room temperature. The d33 values were measured before and after the thermal cycling, and C-scan imaging of the bond was performed at the end of the first and 10th cycles. Reflection and transmission of ultrasonic waves at the interface of two different materials are a function of their characteristic acoustic impedances (Z) which is defined for a material i as, Zi= \u03c1i vi, where \u03c1i is its mass density and vi is the longitudinal wave velocity in that material. The power reflection coefficient (R) for a normal incidence of sound waves at the interface is given by where Z1 and Z2 are the characteristic acoustic impedances of media 1 and 2, respectively. To illustrate this, let us consider the immersion scanning of silver coated PZT discs. When the sound wave propagates through water and then the PZT disc ( (a)), it encounters three interfaces: water-Ag, Ag-PZT and PZT-water. From , the R values at the water-Ag and PZT-water interfaces are very high (85.5 % and 83.6 % respectively). Since the difference in Z values of Ag and PZT is only 4.8 MRayl, the R value at the Ag-PZT interface is negligible, around 0.46 % (using Eq. ). Therefore, to calculate the total sound energy reflected to the transducer (T/R), the energy loss due to reflection at the Ag-PZT interface is not considered. With this approximation, the reflected sound energy from the front and back surfaces of the silver coated PZT disc is calculated to be 85.5 % and 1.76 % respectively (see (a)). In the case of diffusion bonded interface, the silver layer, which was previously coated through screen printing and DC magnetron sputtering, diffuses into the substrate materials (PZT and Ni) leaving behind a thin interlayer between them. Hence, the thickness of the silver layer does not meet the \u03bb/4 criteria for effective sound wave propagation, where \u03bb=360\u03bcm in silver for a 10 MHz longitudinal wave. Consequently, it is reasonable to assume that the ultrasonic wave propagates from Ni to PZT without any considerable reflection at the interlayer interface. In this case, the energy received is reduced to approximately 0.05 % of the initial due to the changes in the acoustic impedances, as illustrated in (b). However, if debonding occurs ((c)), a considerable amount of energy (1.2 %) is reflected to the transducer. Under practical experimental conditions, the energy received at the T/R from a known defect will be set at 80 % of the full screen height (FSH) as the reference amplitude. It should also be noted that the above analysis considered only the planar wavefront emitted by an unfocused immersion transducer. illustrates the schematic of the experimental set up and the XY raster scanning pattern used for c-scan imaging. The specimen was kept at the focal point of a spherically focused immersion transducer (T/R) with a central frequency of 10 MHz, aperture diameter 10 mm, focal length 50 mm and bandwidth \u223c 63 %. This transducer was mounted on a six axes manipulator (Dhvani R&D Solutions, India) and was excited in pulse-echo configuration using a pulser-receiver (DPR300 from JSR Ultrasonics). To ensure proper alignment, the specimen was placed on a calibrated leveling plate and a horizontal level gauge was used to confirm that the specimen\u2019s surface is parallel to the scanning reference plane, minimizing any tilt that could affect the reflected echo strength. The shift in its position was restricted to less than 0.2 mm using the level gauge, ensuring the surface of the specimen remained normal to the ultrasound beam during entire scanning. A raster scan, as shown in (b), was performed with a scanning resolution of 0.1 mm \xd7 0.1 mm in the XY plane. Reflected sound waves from the specimen were digitized using an NI data acquisition card with a 100 MHz sampling rate and acquired with the acqUT\xae software integrated into the six-axis manipulator. The evaluation software (extUT\xae) processed these signals through a Bessel band-pass filter with a bandwidth of 10 \xb1 0.5 MHz. Since the region of interest was the planar interface (XY plane) which was kept perpendicular to the ultrasound beam (Z-direction) at the focal spot ((a)), the reduced axial resolution due to narrow bandwidth would not affect the resultant images. To evaluate the silver coating on the as-received PZT discs, each disc was kept at the focal point of the immersion transducer (T/R). The ultrasonic pulse reflected from the opposite surface of the PZT disc was brought to 80 % of the full-screen height (FSH) by adjusting the gain settings of the pulser-receiver unit (DPR-300). Achieving 80 % FSH of the reflected amplitude facilitated the detection of any loss of back wall echo, which could indicate debonding of the silver layer from the top surface. An XY raster scan, as depicted in (b) was performed to cover the entire surface of the disc. To examine the diffusion-bonded interface between the PZT disc and the nickel wear plate, it was temporarily potted into a one-end-closed nickel housing to prevent the PZT disc from contacting water. shows photographs of nickel housing, diffusion bonded PZT disc and the assembly for immersion scanning. To qualify the bonded interface, the ultrasonic C-scan imaging system was calibrated using the reflected echo from a flat bottom hole (FBH) of diameter 2 mm in a reference nickel plate. The material path above the FBH was equal to the thickness of the Ni plate used for bonding, which is 2 mm. The echo from the FBH was brought to 80 % of the FSH and used as the reference signal to assess the diffusion bonded interface. The bonded interface was placed at the focal spot of the transducer, and an XY raster scan, as depicted in , was performed to cover the entire interface area. (a) illustrates the schematic of the diffusion-bonded ultrasonic transducer. The nickel wear plate, bonded with a PZT disc at 275 \xb0C, was laser welded to the nickel housing of the transducer (shown in (a)). A stainless-steel wire was brazed to the electrode contact plate, which was then brazed to the 3 mm copper conductor of the mineral insulated stainless steel sheathed cable (MI cable). This set up was used to excite the PZT disc with electrical pulses. The sheath of the MI cable was laser welded to a stainless-steel bush, which in turn was laser welded to the cover plate. Extreme care was taken during laser welding to prevent damage to the PZT disc and the diffusion bonded interface. Axial and cross-sectional beam intensity profiles of the under-sodium transducers were obtained using a transducer characterization system (Model TraCSS\xae, Dhvani make, India) integrated to the ultrasonic immersion scanner. The circular face of the under-sodium transducer is assumed to be in the XZ plane of the scanning system, with the Y-axis defined as perpendicular to the transducer face. A typical small transducer, known as pinducer, with a diameter of 1.5 mm, was used to map the beam intensity of the under-sodium transducer. The intensity profile along the XY or ZY planes is referred to as the axial intensity profile, which passes symmetrically through the center axis of the transducer. The cross-sectional intensity profile was obtained in the XZ plane, parallel to the transducer\u2019s face. The TraCSS\xae system provides the parameters of the ultrasonic wave such as peak frequency, center frequency, band width, and ringing time. This arrangement ensured that the target plate was positioned 150 mm from the transducer face, a distance that extends well into the far field of the ultrasonic beam at 1 MHz frequency in the liquid medium. Silicone oil with a flash point approximately 315 \xb0C and a viscosity of 100 cSt @ 250 \xb0C, was used for experiments. The transducer was excited using an ISONIC pulser-receiver unit of Sonotron NDT, UK. Initially, the oil was heated and maintained at \xb1 \xb0CE^{100}E^{1} using a thermocouple and a temperature controller. The oil temperature then increased in steps to 150 \xb0C, 175 \xb0C, 200 \xb0C and finally to 225 \xb0C. After holding the transducer in the oil at 225 \xb0C for one day, the temperature was raised to 250 \xb0C and maintained for 5 days. The transducer was connected to the mating knife-edged flange of the vessel by threading the MI cable through a long stainless-steel tube welded to the flange and hermetically sealing it using a high temperature epoxy. The target plate, like the one used in silicone oil experiments, was fixed to transducer housing by spot welding the stainless-steel rods and positioned 350 mm from the transducer face. The assembly was first heated to approximately 100 \xb0C, and the echo signal reflected from the target plate was recorded. The sodium temperature was then gradually raised to 250 \xb0C and maintained at this temperature for about three months, periodically recording the echo amplitude. As mentioned in , the PZT discs were diffusion bonded to nickel wear plates at two different temperatures: 275 \xb0C and 400 \xb0C. The discs bonded at 400 \xb0C lost their piezoelectric properties since the bonding temperature was above the Curie temperature. Repoling was performed using the DC poling unit (Model: 5/10 DC of Marine India, India). Since electrical conductivity of the sample is a critical parameter in the poling process, electrical conductivities of the PZT discs intended for bonding at 400 \xb0C were measured across a temperature range of 80 \xb0C to 250 \xb0C.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The scanning set up and typical C-scan images of five as-received PZT discs of 2 mm thickness and 20 mm diameter which were screen printed with 25 \u03bcm of silver are shown in. Consequently, the PZT discs exhibiting a 20 % or more reduction in back wall echo amplitude from the reference level was excluded from diffusion bonding. The reflected echo amplitude from the FBH, adjusted to be at 80 % of the FSH, was used as the reference for assessing the quality of the PZT-Ni bond, as discussed in. Given that the acoustic impedance of nickel is 50.7 MRayl and that of the PZT-SP6 is 33 MRayl the R value is calculated to be 0.045. This indicates that only \u223c 4.5 % of the incident energy would be reflected from a Ni-PZT interface. Interfaces with a reflected amplitude exceeding 20 % of the reference amplitude were considered de-bonded. The C-scan images, which map the reflected amplitudes into a color scale, clearly identify and quantify areas with abrupt changes in reflection amplitudes. (a) and 10(b) show a typical diffusion bonded specimen and the C-scan images of the Ni-PZT interfaces of five such specimens, respectively. (c) and 10(d) compare the reflected echoes from the de-bonded and bonded interfaces. The C-scan images were analyzed using a threshold set at 20 % of the reference amplitude, as described in. The area of de-bonding was calculated from the C-scan images and the intensity profile using the relation: Based on the experimental results, only specimens with bonding more than 90 % of the total PZT disc area was selected for fabrication of under sodium transducers intended for deployment in the PFBR. The C-scan images of the interface of the PZT discs bonded to nickel wear plates under four cases outlined in , including after thermal cycles, are shown in. It is evident that the bonding parameters used in cases 1 and 2 (screen-printed silver layer augmented with an additional sputter-coated silver layer, and 20 MPa pressure at either 275 \xb0C (Case 1) or 400 \xb0C (Case 2)) achieved an acceptable bond quality, with the total bonded area exceeding 90 % of the PZT disc area. However, cases 3 and 4 exhibited substantial de-bonding after thermal cycling. presents the average d33 values of two PZT discs of Case 1, measured before bonding, after bonding and after the thermal cycles. The reduction in d33 values observed after bonding and thermal cycling is due to the partial loss of piezoelectric properties of PZT disc upon holding at high temperatures. As the temperature increases, the dipole orientation within the polycrystalline disc becomes partly randomized, leading to a decrease in d33 values. In all these cases, the measurement uncertainty was found to be less than 1 %. It is to be noted that the PZT discs bonded at 400 \xb0C (Cases 2, 3 and 4) experienced a significant loss of piezoelectric properties, with their d33 values approaching zero after bonding. Although the bond quality was satisfactory for Case 2, the PZT disc requires repoling before it can be integrated into the under-sodium transducer. The conductivity (\u03c3) of a 1 MHz PZT disc at different temperatures was measured using the experimental set up depicted in (a). Eq. can be re-written as where A\u2032= (lnA)/E^{2.303}. From the slope of this line (=- Ea/ 2.303kB), the activation energy for conduction in PZT material was calculated to be 0.94 eV. The DC resistance of the PZT discs tends to fall below 1 M\u03a9 at temperatures above 180 \xb0C. Since the maximum permissible leakage current of the poling equipment was 10 mA, a repoling temperature of 150 \xb0C was chosen, where the leakage current was measured at 1.5 mA. During repoling, the PZT discs were immersed in dry silicone oil maintained at 150 \xb0C, and a DC potential of 15 kV was applied across the disc for 15 min. After removal from the silicone oil bath, the discs were cleaned, their d33 values were measured and bond quality was re-examined. The d33 value after repoling was found to be 250 pC/N, similar to the as-received condition, and the bond quality remained satisfactory. It is worth noting that, the solubility of silver in nickel is higher at 400 \xb0C than at 275 \xb0C. Hence, when the bonding is carried out at 400 \xb0C the Ag interlayer thickness gets considerably reduced than when bonding is carried out at 275\xb0C. This is the reason for the relatively better bond quality observed at 275 \xb0C (Case 1, ) compared to 400 \xb0C (Case 2, ). Since the process of bonding at 400 \xb0C requires additional steps of poling the bonded PZT disc for using it in the transducer, we have not explored this aspect further. compares the beam profiles of a qualified 1 MHz transducer with those of a transducer that has poorly bonded PZT disc. On the other hand, debonding of the PZT disc from the Ni wear plate causes light damping of the transducer, resulting in reduced energy output and distortion in the beam\u2019s symmetry. The intensity profile and the wave form were used to calculate the transducer parameters according to ASTM standard E1065. Prior to the liquid sodium experiments, the performance of under-sodium transducers was evaluated in silicone oil at various temperatures (100 \xb0C to 250 \xb0C).

The bonded interface was placed at the focal spot of the transducer, and an XY raster scan, as depicted in , was performed to cover the entire interface area. (a) illustrates the schematic of the diffusion-bonded ultrasonic transducer. The nickel wear plate, bonded with a PZT disc at 275 \xb0C, was laser welded to the nickel housing of the transducer (shown in (a)). A stainless-steel wire was brazed to the electrode contact plate, which was then brazed to the 3 mm copper conductor of the mineral insulated stainless steel sheathed cable (MI cable). This set up was used to excite the PZT disc with electrical pulses. The sheath of the MI cable was laser welded to a stainless-steel bush, which in turn was laser welded to the cover plate. Extreme care was taken during laser welding to prevent damage to the PZT disc and the diffusion bonded interface. Axial and cross-sectional beam intensity profiles of the under-sodium transducers were obtained using a transducer characterization system (Model TraCSS\xae, Dhvani make, India) integrated to the ultrasonic immersion scanner. The circular face of the under-sodium transducer is assumed to be in the XZ plane of the scanning system, with the Y-axis defined as perpendicular to the transducer face. A typical small transducer, known as pinducer, with a diameter of 1.5 mm, was used to map the beam intensity of the under-sodium transducer. The intensity profile along the XY or ZY planes is referred to as the axial intensity profile, which passes symmetrically through the center axis of the transducer. The cross-sectional intensity profile was obtained in the XZ plane, parallel to the transducer\u2019s face. The TraCSS\xae system provides the parameters of the ultrasonic wave such as peak frequency, center frequency, band width, and ringing time. This arrangement ensured that the target plate was positioned 150 mm from the transducer face, a distance that extends well into the far field of the ultrasonic beam at 1 MHz frequency in the liquid medium. Silicone oil with a flash point approximately 315 \xb0C and a viscosity of 100 cSt @ 250 \xb0C, was used for experiments. The transducer was excited using an ISONIC pulser-receiver unit of Sonotron NDT, UK. Initially, the oil was heated and maintained at \xb1 \xb0CE^{100}E^{1} using a thermocouple and a temperature controller. The oil temperature then increased in steps to 150 \xb0C, 175 \xb0C, 200 \xb0C and finally to 225 \xb0C. After holding the transducer in the oil at 225 \xb0C for one day, the temperature was raised to 250 \xb0C and maintained for 5 days. The transducer was connected to the mating knife-edged flange of the vessel by threading the MI cable through a long stainless-steel tube welded to the flange and hermetically sealing it using a high temperature epoxy. The target plate, like the one used in silicone oil experiments, was fixed to transducer housing by spot welding the stainless-steel rods and positioned 350 mm from the transducer face. The assembly was first heated to approximately 100 \xb0C, and the echo signal reflected from the target plate was recorded. The sodium temperature was then gradually raised to 250 \xb0C and maintained at this temperature for about three months, periodically recording the echo amplitude. As mentioned in , the PZT discs were diffusion bonded to nickel wear plates at two different temperatures: 275 \xb0C and 400 \xb0C. The discs bonded at 400 \xb0C lost their piezoelectric properties since the bonding temperature was above the Curie temperature. Repoling was performed using the DC poling unit (Model: 5/10 DC of Marine India, India). Since electrical conductivity of the sample is a critical parameter in the poling process, electrical conductivities of the PZT discs intended for bonding at 400 \xb0C were measured across a temperature range of 80 \xb0C to 250 \xb0C.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The scanning set up and typical C-scan images of five as-received PZT discs of 2 mm thickness and 20 mm diameter which were screen printed with 25 \u03bcm of silver are shown in. Consequently, the PZT discs exhibiting a 20 % or more reduction in back wall echo amplitude from the reference level was excluded from diffusion bonding. The reflected echo amplitude from the FBH, adjusted to be at 80 % of the FSH, was used as the reference for assessing the quality of the PZT-Ni bond, as discussed in. Given that the acoustic impedance of nickel is 50.7 MRayl and that of the PZT-SP6 is 33 MRayl the R value is calculated to be 0.045. This indicates that only \u223c 4.5 % of the incident energy would be reflected from a Ni-PZT interface. Interfaces with a reflected amplitude exceeding 20 % of the reference amplitude were considered de-bonded. The C-scan images, which map the reflected amplitudes into a color scale, clearly identify and quantify areas with abrupt changes in reflection amplitudes. (a) and 10(b) show a typical diffusion bonded specimen and the C-scan images of the Ni-PZT interfaces of five such specimens, respectively. (c) and 10(d) compare the reflected echoes from the de-bonded and bonded interfaces. The C-scan images were analyzed using a threshold set at 20 % of the reference amplitude, as described in. The area of de-bonding was calculated from the C-scan images and the intensity profile using the relation: Based on the experimental results, only specimens with bonding more than 90 % of the total PZT disc area was selected for fabrication of under sodium transducers intended for deployment in the PFBR. The C-scan images of the interface of the PZT discs bonded to nickel wear plates under four cases outlined in , including after thermal cycles, are shown in. It is evident that the bonding parameters used in cases 1 and 2 (screen-printed silver layer augmented with an additional sputter-coated silver layer, and 20 MPa pressure at either 275 \xb0C (Case 1) or 400 \xb0C (Case 2)) achieved an acceptable bond quality, with the total bonded area exceeding 90 % of the PZT disc area. However, cases 3 and 4 exhibited substantial de-bonding after thermal cycling. presents the average d33 values of two PZT discs of Case 1, measured before bonding, after bonding and after the thermal cycles. The reduction in d33 values observed after bonding and thermal cycling is due to the partial loss of piezoelectric properties of PZT disc upon holding at high temperatures. As the temperature increases, the dipole orientation within the polycrystalline disc becomes partly randomized, leading to a decrease in d33 values. In all these cases, the measurement uncertainty was found to be less than 1 %. It is to be noted that the PZT discs bonded at 400 \xb0C (Cases 2, 3 and 4) experienced a significant loss of piezoelectric properties, with their d33 values approaching zero after bonding. Although the bond quality was satisfactory for Case 2, the PZT disc requires repoling before it can be integrated into the under-sodium transducer. The conductivity (\u03c3) of a 1 MHz PZT disc at different temperatures was measured using the experimental set up depicted in (a). Eq. can be re-written as where A\u2032= (lnA)/E^{2.303}. From the slope of this line (=- Ea/ 2.303kB), the activation energy for conduction in PZT material was calculated to be 0.94 eV. The DC resistance of the PZT discs tends to fall below 1 M\u03a9 at temperatures above 180 \xb0C. Since the maximum permissible leakage current of the poling equipment was 10 mA, a repoling temperature of 150 \xb0C was chosen, where the leakage current was measured at 1.5 mA. During repoling, the PZT discs were immersed in dry silicone oil maintained at 150 \xb0C, and a DC potential of 15 kV was applied across the disc for 15 min. After removal from the silicone oil bath, the discs were cleaned, their d33 values were measured and bond quality was re-examined. The d33 value after repoling was found to be 250 pC/N, similar to the as-received condition, and the bond quality remained satisfactory. It is worth noting that, the solubility of silver in nickel is higher at 400 \xb0C than at 275 \xb0C. Hence, when the bonding is carried out at 400 \xb0C the Ag interlayer thickness gets considerably reduced than when bonding is carried out at 275\xb0C. This is the reason for the relatively better bond quality observed at 275 \xb0C (Case 1, ) compared to 400 \xb0C (Case 2, ). Since the process of bonding at 400 \xb0C requires additional steps of poling the bonded PZT disc for using it in the transducer, we have not explored this aspect further. compares the beam profiles of a qualified 1 MHz transducer with those of a transducer that has poorly bonded PZT disc. On the other hand, debonding of the PZT disc from the Ni wear plate causes light damping of the transducer, resulting in reduced energy output and distortion in the beam\u2019s symmetry. The intensity profile and the wave form were used to calculate the transducer parameters according to ASTM standard E1065. Prior to the liquid sodium experiments, the performance of under-sodium transducers was evaluated in silicone oil at various temperatures (100 \xb0C to 250 \xb0C).
