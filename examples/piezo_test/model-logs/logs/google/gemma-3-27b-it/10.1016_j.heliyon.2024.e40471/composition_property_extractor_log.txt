# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The XRD patterns of the PBN and NdE^{3+} modified PBN ceramic compositions at room temperature show the single-phase tetragonal structure for all samples as shown in. The lattice constants of PBN with a = 12.505 \xc5 and c = 3.984 \xc5 well matched with reported values. The lattice parameter a (\xc5) decreases with NdE^{3+} concentration in PBN ceramic compositions. The XRD peaks match well with the JCPDS file no. C34-375. Substitution of NdE^{3+} does not affect the symmetry but affects the lattice parameters as shown in. The decrease in lattice parameters with increasing Nd concentration is due to the smaller ionic radius of Nd\xb3\u207a (0.983 \xc5) compared to the larger ions (PbE^{2}\u207a and BaE^{2}\u207a) it replaces in the PBN structure. As Nd\xb3\u207a ions substitute these larger ions, the unit cell contracts, causing a reduction in lattice parameters. The maximum value (12.505 \xc5) in PBN-1 reflects the structure before significant Nd\xb3\u207a incorporation, as shown in (a). The Rietveld's refinement pattern for the XRD data of the synthesized nanostructures for x = 0.00 is presented in. The Rietveld refinement profile of the XRD data demonstrates a good fit between the experimental data (dots) and the calculated profile (solid line). The consistent peak alignment across the different samples, along with the refined fit, confirms the phase stability of the PBN ceramics. When compared with the literature, these results are consistent with typical PBN-based ceramics, where doping with rare-earth ions such as Nd\xb3\u207a can slightly influence lattice parameters without significantly disrupting the crystalline structure. The average crystallite sizes of Pb\u2081\u208b\u2093\u208b\u2083y/\u2082Ba\u2093Re\u1d67\xb3\u207aNb\u2082O\u2086 ceramics (PBN) with Nd\xb3\u207a doping (x = 0.35, y = 0.00\u20130.06) are 22.7 nm, 22.6 nm, 23.2 and 25.11 nm respectively (listed in ), showing a gradual increase with higher Nd\xb3\u207a substitution as shown in. Comparable literature on Nd\xb3\u207a doped PBN ceramics also shows crystallite sizes typically between 20 and 30 nm, confirming that the observed growth is consistent with the behavior of Nd\xb3\u207a as a dopant enhancing grain size at higher doping levels. Yuhan  et al. reported a decrease in cell volume with neodymium-doped in Strontium Sodium Barium Niobate (SSBN) Ceramics. Cell volume in NdE^{3+} doped Lead Barium Niobate ceramic materials is found to be low in comparison to unmodified Lead Barium Niobate. Hence the contraction in cell volume is been found and it is not by the ionic radii of NdE^{3+} rare earth ions. A similar decrease in cell volume is reported by the earlier authors in rare earth ion substituted in BSN  and BSNN  ceramics. The experimental densities are found in the range of 5.78\u20135.90 g/cmE^{3} as presented in. The densities of the samples decrease with the increase of NdE^{3+} concentration in PBN. The decrease in density percentage with increasing Nd\xb3\u207a concentration from 0.00 to 0.06, can be attributed to the lower atomic mass of Nd\xb3\u207a compared to the ions it replaces (PbE^{2}\u207a and BaE^{2}\u207a). As Nd\xb3\u207a ions substitute these heavier ions, the overall mass of the unit cell decreases, leading to a reduction in the material's theoretical density. Additionally, Nd\xb3\u207a substitution may introduce lattice distortions or vacancies, further lowering the packing efficiency and contributing to the reduced density percentage. The axial ratio increases in PBN ceramics with an increase in the concentration of the NdE^{3+} dopants. The axial ratios are found to be between 1.007 and 1.009. A small axial ratio indicates that the NbO\u2086 octahedra in the TB structure experiences little distortion, maintaining a near-ideal octahedral geometry. The distortion of NbO\u2086 units affects the local electric field and piezoelectric properties. The maximum value of the lattice parameter obtained in PBN-1 is 12.505 \xc5. The highest density observed in PBN-1 composition is 5.90 g/cmE^{3}. It is evident from that with an increase of NdE^{3+} composition from 0.00 to 0.06 the density percentage decreased. Relative density is calculated as the ratio of the experimental density (\u03c1ex) to the theoretical density (\u03c1th), expressed as a percentage. As shown in the data, the relative densities of the Nd\xb3\u207a modified and unmodified PBN ceramics range from 95.0 % to 96.0 %, indicating high densification across all compositions. SEM images of unmodified PBN and NdE^{3+} modified PBN compositions and associated histograms showing the distribution of nanoparticles are shown in (a)\u2013(d). The standard deviations of the grain sizes are 0.77321, 1.57002, 0.498693, and 0.458734 respectively. Also, the grain size increased with the increase of NdE^{3+} doped in PBN ceramics. The graph of grain size with an increase of NdE^{3+} concentration is shown in. From the figure, it is clear that the maximum density and grain size were observed in the PBN-1 composition. The porosity value for PBN-1 is 0.04 and the maximum porosity achieved in PBNN-3 is 0.055. Porosity increases with NdE^{3+} content at which Pb content is decreasing on the other side as shown in (b). The atomic and weight percentages of NdE^{3+} modified and unmodified PBN ceramics are presented in. For each composition, the EDS peak positions include these characteristic X-ray peaks at different energy levels. For PBN1, Lead (Pb) has two peaks at L\u03b1: \u223c10.55 keV and M\u03b1: \u223c2.34 keV; Barium (Ba) has two peaks at L\u03b1: \u223c4.47 keV and M\u03b1: \u223c0.72 keV, Niobium (Nb) has two peaks at L\u03b1: \u223c2.16 keV and K\u03b1: \u223c16.6 keV and Oxygen (O) has a single peak at K\u03b1: \u223c0.525 keV. for PBNN2, the peaks are same as above with additional two peaks of Neodymium (Nd) at L\u03b1: \u223c5.23 keV and M\u03b1: \u223c0.98 keV. for PBNN3, it has peaks similar to the second composition but with slightly higher Nd peak intensity. For PBNN4, the Nd peaks will be more pronounced at 5.23 keV and 0.98 keV. The pattern shows that these energies are approximate and can shift slightly depending on the calibration of your EDS system. This study explores the impact of neodymium (NdE^{3+}) doping on the piezoelectric properties of PBN ceramics. The XRD patterns presented in the paper show that pure and NdE^{3+}-modified PBN ceramics exhibit a single-phase tetragonal structure, consistent with prior studies. The decrease in lattice parameter 'a' with increasing NdE^{3+} concentration aligns with findings by Rao et al., who reported similar trends in Strontium Sodium Barium Niobate (SSBN) ceramics. This decrease is attributed to the substitution of NdE^{3+} ions, which causes a contraction in cell volume, a phenomenon also observed in rare earth ion-substituted Barium Sodium Niobate (BSN) and Barium Strontium Sodium Niobate (BSNN) ceramics. There is a decrease in density with increased NdE^{3+} concentration, which falls within the range of 5.78\u20135.90 g/cm\xb3. This observation is in line with earlier studies that noted density variations in doped PBN ceramics. The dielectric properties of NdE^{3+}-doped PBN ceramics show a broad dielectric peak, with the phase transition temperature (TC) remaining consistent with reported values. The maximum piezoelectric coefficient (d33) increases with NdE^{3+} concentration, achieving a peak value of 236 pC/N for PBNN-4. SEM images indicate that NdE^{3+} doping affects the grain size and porosity of PBN ceramics. The maximum grain size and density were observed in the undoped PBN composition, while NdE^{3+} doping led to a reduction in grain size and an increase in porosity. Like, the structural consistency shown by maintaining a tetragonal structure with NdE^{3+} doping is consistent with earlier work on rare-earth-doped niobate ceramics. Similarly, the improvement in piezoelectric properties with NdE^{3+} concentration echoes results from studies on other doped piezoelectric materials. So, this paper effectively builds on existing literature by demonstrating that NdE^{3+} doping can enhance the piezoelectric properties of PBN ceramics, making them suitable for advanced device applications. This work provides valuable insights into the material properties and potential applications of NdE^{3+}-doped PBN, contributing to the broader understanding of ferroelectric and piezoelectric materials. In brief, this study describes the structural, microstructural, and piezoelectric properties of PBN (probably Pb(Nb, Zr)O3 or a similar lead-based perovskite material) and NdE^{3+} modified PBN ceramics. The piezoelectric charge coefficients d11 and d33 indicate that these materials can be used in devices that rely on piezoelectricity, such as sensors, actuators, and transducers. The increase in d11 and d33 with NdE^{3+} concentration suggests enhanced piezoelectric performance. b. The transition temperature (TC) values (350 \xb0C for undoped PBN and decreasing with NdE^{3+} doping) suggest that these materials can operate at elevated temperatures. The high piezoelectric coefficients and mechanical stability indicate potential use in precision actuators, which require accurate motion control and are used in applications like adaptive optics, nano-positioning systems, and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS).

# TITLE
Influence of Nd<sup>3+</sup> ion on piezoelectric studies in lead barium niobate ferroelectric ceramics for device applications

# ABSTRACT
Pb₁₋ₓ₋₃y/₂BaₓReᵧ³⁺Nb₂O₆ (PBN) ceramics, where x = 0.35 and y = 0.00, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, and Re³⁺ = Nd³⁺, were successfully synthesized using the solid-state reaction method. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis confirmed the formation of a pure, single-phase tetragonal structure in both undoped and Nd³⁺-modified PBN ceramics. Rietveld refinement demonstrated a strong correlation between experimental and calculated profiles, with crystallite sizes ranging from 22.6 to 25.11 nm, indicating a gradual increase in size with increasing Nd³⁺ substitution. Grain size analysis showed values between 1.09 μm and 3.95 μm, with the microstructure becoming more refined as Nd³⁺ content increased. The maximum density of 5.95 g/cm³ was achieved at y = 0.06, reflecting optimal densification from Nd³⁺ modification. Dielectric studies revealed that the phase transition temperature (Tc) followed a consistent trend, with the undoped PBN-1 showing a Tc of 350 °C, and Nd³⁺-modified compositions exhibiting lower transition temperatures of 330 °C, 315 °C, and 283 °C as Nd³⁺ content increased. The dielectric constant (Kp) reached a peak value of 0.39 at the Curie temperature and broadened with increasing Nd³⁺ content, indicating enhanced temperature stability. Furthermore, the piezoelectric coefficient (d₃₃) improved significantly with Nd³⁺ doping, reaching a maximum of 178 pC/N for y = 0.06, signifying enhanced piezoelectric performance. These results demonstrate that Nd³⁺-modified PBN ceramics are promising candidates for high-performance piezoelectric applications, particularly in environments demanding high-temperature stability and superior piezoelectric properties.

# INTRODUCTION
Notable ferroelectric materials such as Lead Titanate (PbTiO3) , Lead Zirconate (PbZrO3) , and Lead Meta Niobate (PbNb2O6)  were discovered in the early 1950s. Among them, PbNb2O6 was confirmed as a ferroelectric material by Goodman and Roth , and its structural and electrical properties were further examined by Francombe and Lewis. Recent research has shifted toward enhancing the dielectric and piezoelectric properties of niobate-based ceramics, with significant studies on compounds like Strontium Barium Niobate (SBN) by Deshpande , which demonstrated a broad maximum dielectric property between 65 \xb0C and 95 \xb0C. Lead Barium Niobate (PBN), composed of Lead Niobate and Barium Niobate, has attracted attention due to its morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) and the ability to accommodate ionic substitutions in its tungsten bronze (TB)-type structure, making it versatile for piezoelectric and dielectric applications. WE^{6+} doping in PBN has shown potential for improving piezoelectric properties, as evidenced by a piezoelectric coefficient of 108 pC/N in WE^{6+}-doped compositions. However, the effect of rare earth ion (NdE^{3+}) doping in Lead Barium Niobate ceramics remains underexplored. Previous studies have only briefly examined how such doping influences material properties, leaving a significant gap in understanding the full potential of NdE^{3+} doped PBN ceramics. However, lead-based ceramics such as Pb1-x-3y/2Ba\u2093Rey\xb3\u207aNb\u2082O\u2086 still offer exceptional piezoelectric and dielectric properties, particularly in high-temperature applications, where lead-free alternatives often fall short. Lead-based materials, including PBN ceramics, are preferred in certain high-performance applications due to their higher Curie temperatures and superior piezoelectric responses. Moreover, Nd\xb3\u207a-modified lead-based systems, like those studied here, have been shown to enhance functional properties, contributing to their continued relevance. Thus, while acknowledging the advancements in lead-free ceramics, the use of lead-based PBN ceramics in our study is justified by their superior performance in specific high-temperature and piezoelectric applications, further optimized by Nd\xb3\u207a doping. The primary objective of this study is to present a systematic investigation of the effect of NdE^{3+} doping on the piezoelectric and dielectric properties of PBN ceramics. The novelty lies in the exploration of NdE^{3+} ion concentration (y = 0.00, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06) and its impact on key material parameters such as grain size, density, dielectric constant, phase transition temperature (TC), and piezoelectric coefficient (d33). The study demonstrates that NdE^{3+} doping enhances the piezoelectric and dielectric performance of PBN ceramics, particularly in high-temperature applications, where material stability is crucial. This work provides new insights into tailoring PBN ceramics for advanced device applications requiring high-temperature stability and improved piezoelectric properties. However, the investigation is limited to a narrow range of NdE^{3+} concentrations, which, although sufficient to observe trends, may not fully explore the upper or lower bounds of the dopant's effects. Additionally, while the study provides a comprehensive understanding of material properties, further work is needed to assess the long-term stability and performance of NdE^{3+}-doped PBN ceramics in real-world applications, particularly in high-temperature or high-stress environments. Future studies could also explore how NdE^{3+} doping interacts with other dopants or synthesis techniques to further optimize the material's properties and offer new opportunities for developing materials with enhanced piezoelectric and dielectric properties for advanced technological applications. Lead Barium Niobate (Pb\u2081\u208b\u2093Ba\u2093Nb\u2082O\u2086) ceramics can be synthesized using various methods, like sol-gel , co-precipitation , hydrothermal , molten salt , microwave-assisted , etc., but the most common and efficient approach is the solid-state reaction method. In this study, The PBN ceramics with NdE^{3+} doping were synthesized using the conventional solid-state reaction method. The structural characterization was carried out using X-ray diffraction (XRD) to confirm the formation of the single-phase tetragonal structure. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to analyze the grain morphology and size distribution, while dielectric and piezoelectric properties were measured to evaluate the functional performance of the NdE^{3+} modified PBN ceramics.

# CONCLUSION
Pb\u2081\u208b\u2093\u208b\u2083y/\u2082Ba\u2093Re\u1d67\xb3\u207aNb\u2082O\u2086 ceramics (for x = 0.35 and y = 0.00, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, and Re\xb3\u207a = Nd\xb3\u207a) were successfully synthesized using the solid-state reaction method. The XRD patterns confirmed a single-phase tetragonal structure for undoped PBN (a = 12.505 \xc5, c = 3.984 \xc5) and Nd\xb3\u207a-modified PBN ceramics. The average crystallite size increased gradually with Nd\xb3\u207a substitution, measured as 22.7 nm, 22.6 nm, 23.2 nm, and 25.11 nm for increasing doping levels. SEM images revealed dense, spherical grains with slight morphological deviations as the Nd\xb3\u207a concentration increased. The Curie temperature (Tc) decreased from 350 \xb0C for undoped PBN to 330 \xb0C, 315 \xb0C, and 283 \xb0C with increasing Nd\xb3\u207a content. Regarding piezoelectric properties, the electromechanical coupling factors (k\u209c and k\u209a) increased with Nd\xb3\u207a concentration: k\u209c rose from 0.43 to 0.47, while k\u209a increased from 0.35 to 0.38. However, these values remained slightly lower than those of pure PBN. The piezoelectric charge coefficients d\u2081\u2081 and d\u2083\u2083 also increased with Nd\xb3\u207a content, rising from 125 to 140 pC/N for d\u2081\u2081 and from 170 to 190 pC/N for d\u2083\u2083. Similarly, the mechanical quality factor (Q\u2098) improved from 78 to 90. These findings indicate that Nd\xb3\u207a doping significantly enhances the piezoelectric performance, making Nd\xb3\u207a-modified PBN ceramics promising candidates for high-performance piezoelectric applications, particularly in environments requiring high-temperature stability and improved piezoelectric properties.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The XRD patterns of the PBN and NdE^{3+} modified PBN ceramic compositions at room temperature show the single-phase tetragonal structure for all samples as shown in. The lattice constants of PBN with a = 12.505 \xc5 and c = 3.984 \xc5 well matched with reported values. The lattice parameter a (\xc5) decreases with NdE^{3+} concentration in PBN ceramic compositions. The XRD peaks match well with the JCPDS file no. C34-375. Substitution of NdE^{3+} does not affect the symmetry but affects the lattice parameters as shown in. The decrease in lattice parameters with increasing Nd concentration is due to the smaller ionic radius of Nd\xb3\u207a (0.983 \xc5) compared to the larger ions (PbE^{2}\u207a and BaE^{2}\u207a) it replaces in the PBN structure. As Nd\xb3\u207a ions substitute these larger ions, the unit cell contracts, causing a reduction in lattice parameters. The maximum value (12.505 \xc5) in PBN-1 reflects the structure before significant Nd\xb3\u207a incorporation, as shown in (a). The Rietveld's refinement pattern for the XRD data of the synthesized nanostructures for x = 0.00 is presented in. The Rietveld refinement profile of the XRD data demonstrates a good fit between the experimental data (dots) and the calculated profile (solid line). The consistent peak alignment across the different samples, along with the refined fit, confirms the phase stability of the PBN ceramics. When compared with the literature, these results are consistent with typical PBN-based ceramics, where doping with rare-earth ions such as Nd\xb3\u207a can slightly influence lattice parameters without significantly disrupting the crystalline structure. The average crystallite sizes of Pb\u2081\u208b\u2093\u208b\u2083y/\u2082Ba\u2093Re\u1d67\xb3\u207aNb\u2082O\u2086 ceramics (PBN) with Nd\xb3\u207a doping (x = 0.35, y = 0.00\u20130.06) are 22.7 nm, 22.6 nm, 23.2 and 25.11 nm respectively (listed in ), showing a gradual increase with higher Nd\xb3\u207a substitution as shown in. Comparable literature on Nd\xb3\u207a doped PBN ceramics also shows crystallite sizes typically between 20 and 30 nm, confirming that the observed growth is consistent with the behavior of Nd\xb3\u207a as a dopant enhancing grain size at higher doping levels. Yuhan  et al. reported a decrease in cell volume with neodymium-doped in Strontium Sodium Barium Niobate (SSBN) Ceramics. Cell volume in NdE^{3+} doped Lead Barium Niobate ceramic materials is found to be low in comparison to unmodified Lead Barium Niobate. Hence the contraction in cell volume is been found and it is not by the ionic radii of NdE^{3+} rare earth ions. A similar decrease in cell volume is reported by the earlier authors in rare earth ion substituted in BSN  and BSNN  ceramics. The experimental densities are found in the range of 5.78\u20135.90 g/cmE^{3} as presented in. The densities of the samples decrease with the increase of NdE^{3+} concentration in PBN. The decrease in density percentage with increasing Nd\xb3\u207a concentration from 0.00 to 0.06, can be attributed to the lower atomic mass of Nd\xb3\u207a compared to the ions it replaces (PbE^{2}\u207a and BaE^{2}\u207a). As Nd\xb3\u207a ions substitute these heavier ions, the overall mass of the unit cell decreases, leading to a reduction in the material's theoretical density. Additionally, Nd\xb3\u207a substitution may introduce lattice distortions or vacancies, further lowering the packing efficiency and contributing to the reduced density percentage. The axial ratio increases in PBN ceramics with an increase in the concentration of the NdE^{3+} dopants. The axial ratios are found to be between 1.007 and 1.009. A small axial ratio indicates that the NbO\u2086 octahedra in the TB structure experiences little distortion, maintaining a near-ideal octahedral geometry. The distortion of NbO\u2086 units affects the local electric field and piezoelectric properties. The maximum value of the lattice parameter obtained in PBN-1 is 12.505 \xc5. The highest density observed in PBN-1 composition is 5.90 g/cmE^{3}. It is evident from that with an increase of NdE^{3+} composition from 0.00 to 0.06 the density percentage decreased. Relative density is calculated as the ratio of the experimental density (\u03c1ex) to the theoretical density (\u03c1th), expressed as a percentage. As shown in the data, the relative densities of the Nd\xb3\u207a modified and unmodified PBN ceramics range from 95.0 % to 96.0 %, indicating high densification across all compositions. SEM images of unmodified PBN and NdE^{3+} modified PBN compositions and associated histograms showing the distribution of nanoparticles are shown in (a)\u2013(d). The standard deviations of the grain sizes are 0.77321, 1.57002, 0.498693, and 0.458734 respectively. Also, the grain size increased with the increase of NdE^{3+} doped in PBN ceramics. The graph of grain size with an increase of NdE^{3+} concentration is shown in. From the figure, it is clear that the maximum density and grain size were observed in the PBN-1 composition. The porosity value for PBN-1 is 0.04 and the maximum porosity achieved in PBNN-3 is 0.055. Porosity increases with NdE^{3+} content at which Pb content is decreasing on the other side as shown in (b). The atomic and weight percentages of NdE^{3+} modified and unmodified PBN ceramics are presented in. For each composition, the EDS peak positions include these characteristic X-ray peaks at different energy levels. For PBN1, Lead (Pb) has two peaks at L\u03b1: \u223c10.55 keV and M\u03b1: \u223c2.34 keV; Barium (Ba) has two peaks at L\u03b1: \u223c4.47 keV and M\u03b1: \u223c0.72 keV, Niobium (Nb) has two peaks at L\u03b1: \u223c2.16 keV and K\u03b1: \u223c16.6 keV and Oxygen (O) has a single peak at K\u03b1: \u223c0.525 keV. for PBNN2, the peaks are same as above with additional two peaks of Neodymium (Nd) at L\u03b1: \u223c5.23 keV and M\u03b1: \u223c0.98 keV. for PBNN3, it has peaks similar to the second composition but with slightly higher Nd peak intensity. For PBNN4, the Nd peaks will be more pronounced at 5.23 keV and 0.98 keV. The pattern shows that these energies are approximate and can shift slightly depending on the calibration of your EDS system. This study explores the impact of neodymium (NdE^{3+}) doping on the piezoelectric properties of PBN ceramics. The XRD patterns presented in the paper show that pure and NdE^{3+}-modified PBN ceramics exhibit a single-phase tetragonal structure, consistent with prior studies. The decrease in lattice parameter 'a' with increasing NdE^{3+} concentration aligns with findings by Rao et al., who reported similar trends in Strontium Sodium Barium Niobate (SSBN) ceramics. This decrease is attributed to the substitution of NdE^{3+} ions, which causes a contraction in cell volume, a phenomenon also observed in rare earth ion-substituted Barium Sodium Niobate (BSN) and Barium Strontium Sodium Niobate (BSNN) ceramics. There is a decrease in density with increased NdE^{3+} concentration, which falls within the range of 5.78\u20135.90 g/cm\xb3. This observation is in line with earlier studies that noted density variations in doped PBN ceramics. The dielectric properties of NdE^{3+}-doped PBN ceramics show a broad dielectric peak, with the phase transition temperature (TC) remaining consistent with reported values. The maximum piezoelectric coefficient (d33) increases with NdE^{3+} concentration, achieving a peak value of 236 pC/N for PBNN-4. SEM images indicate that NdE^{3+} doping affects the grain size and porosity of PBN ceramics. The maximum grain size and density were observed in the undoped PBN composition, while NdE^{3+} doping led to a reduction in grain size and an increase in porosity. Like, the structural consistency shown by maintaining a tetragonal structure with NdE^{3+} doping is consistent with earlier work on rare-earth-doped niobate ceramics. Similarly, the improvement in piezoelectric properties with NdE^{3+} concentration echoes results from studies on other doped piezoelectric materials. So, this paper effectively builds on existing literature by demonstrating that NdE^{3+} doping can enhance the piezoelectric properties of PBN ceramics, making them suitable for advanced device applications. This work provides valuable insights into the material properties and potential applications of NdE^{3+}-doped PBN, contributing to the broader understanding of ferroelectric and piezoelectric materials. In brief, this study describes the structural, microstructural, and piezoelectric properties of PBN (probably Pb(Nb, Zr)O3 or a similar lead-based perovskite material) and NdE^{3+} modified PBN ceramics. The piezoelectric charge coefficients d11 and d33 indicate that these materials can be used in devices that rely on piezoelectricity, such as sensors, actuators, and transducers. The increase in d11 and d33 with NdE^{3+} concentration suggests enhanced piezoelectric performance. b. The transition temperature (TC) values (350 \xb0C for undoped PBN and decreasing with NdE^{3+} doping) suggest that these materials can operate at elevated temperatures. The high piezoelectric coefficients and mechanical stability indicate potential use in precision actuators, which require accurate motion control and are used in applications like adaptive optics, nano-positioning systems, and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS).

Influence of Nd<sup>3+</sup> ion on piezoelectric studies in lead barium niobate ferroelectric ceramics for device applications

# ABSTRACT
Pb₁₋ₓ₋₃y/₂BaₓReᵧ³⁺Nb₂O₆ (PBN) ceramics, where x = 0.35 and y = 0.00, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, and Re³⁺ = Nd³⁺, were successfully synthesized using the solid-state reaction method. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis confirmed the formation of a pure, single-phase tetragonal structure in both undoped and Nd³⁺-modified PBN ceramics. Rietveld refinement demonstrated a strong correlation between experimental and calculated profiles, with crystallite sizes ranging from 22.6 to 25.11 nm, indicating a gradual increase in size with increasing Nd³⁺ substitution. Grain size analysis showed values between 1.09 μm and 3.95 μm, with the microstructure becoming more refined as Nd³⁺ content increased. The maximum density of 5.95 g/cm³ was achieved at y = 0.06, reflecting optimal densification from Nd³⁺ modification. Dielectric studies revealed that the phase transition temperature (Tc) followed a consistent trend, with the undoped PBN-1 showing a Tc of 350 °C, and Nd³⁺-modified compositions exhibiting lower transition temperatures of 330 °C, 315 °C, and 283 °C as Nd³⁺ content increased. The dielectric constant (Kp) reached a peak value of 0.39 at the Curie temperature and broadened with increasing Nd³⁺ content, indicating enhanced temperature stability. Furthermore, the piezoelectric coefficient (d₃₃) improved significantly with Nd³⁺ doping, reaching a maximum of 178 pC/N for y = 0.06, signifying enhanced piezoelectric performance. These results demonstrate that Nd³⁺-modified PBN ceramics are promising candidates for high-performance piezoelectric applications, particularly in environments demanding high-temperature stability and superior piezoelectric properties.

# INTRODUCTION
Notable ferroelectric materials such as Lead Titanate (PbTiO3) , Lead Zirconate (PbZrO3) , and Lead Meta Niobate (PbNb2O6)  were discovered in the early 1950s. Among them, PbNb2O6 was confirmed as a ferroelectric material by Goodman and Roth , and its structural and electrical properties were further examined by Francombe and Lewis. Recent research has shifted toward enhancing the dielectric and piezoelectric properties of niobate-based ceramics, with significant studies on compounds like Strontium Barium Niobate (SBN) by Deshpande , which demonstrated a broad maximum dielectric property between 65 \xb0C and 95 \xb0C. Lead Barium Niobate (PBN), composed of Lead Niobate and Barium Niobate, has attracted attention due to its morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) and the ability to accommodate ionic substitutions in its tungsten bronze (TB)-type structure, making it versatile for piezoelectric and dielectric applications. WE^{6+} doping in PBN has shown potential for improving piezoelectric properties, as evidenced by a piezoelectric coefficient of 108 pC/N in WE^{6+}-doped compositions. However, the effect of rare earth ion (NdE^{3+}) doping in Lead Barium Niobate ceramics remains underexplored. Previous studies have only briefly examined how such doping influences material properties, leaving a significant gap in understanding the full potential of NdE^{3+} doped PBN ceramics. However, lead-based ceramics such as Pb1-x-3y/2Ba\u2093Rey\xb3\u207aNb\u2082O\u2086 still offer exceptional piezoelectric and dielectric properties, particularly in high-temperature applications, where lead-free alternatives often fall short. Lead-based materials, including PBN ceramics, are preferred in certain high-performance applications due to their higher Curie temperatures and superior piezoelectric responses. Moreover, Nd\xb3\u207a-modified lead-based systems, like those studied here, have been shown to enhance functional properties, contributing to their continued relevance. Thus, while acknowledging the advancements in lead-free ceramics, the use of lead-based PBN ceramics in our study is justified by their superior performance in specific high-temperature and piezoelectric applications, further optimized by Nd\xb3\u207a doping. The primary objective of this study is to present a systematic investigation of the effect of NdE^{3+} doping on the piezoelectric and dielectric properties of PBN ceramics. The novelty lies in the exploration of NdE^{3+} ion concentration (y = 0.00, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06) and its impact on key material parameters such as grain size, density, dielectric constant, phase transition temperature (TC), and piezoelectric coefficient (d33). The study demonstrates that NdE^{3+} doping enhances the piezoelectric and dielectric performance of PBN ceramics, particularly in high-temperature applications, where material stability is crucial. This work provides new insights into tailoring PBN ceramics for advanced device applications requiring high-temperature stability and improved piezoelectric properties. However, the investigation is limited to a narrow range of NdE^{3+} concentrations, which, although sufficient to observe trends, may not fully explore the upper or lower bounds of the dopant's effects. Additionally, while the study provides a comprehensive understanding of material properties, further work is needed to assess the long-term stability and performance of NdE^{3+}-doped PBN ceramics in real-world applications, particularly in high-temperature or high-stress environments. Future studies could also explore how NdE^{3+} doping interacts with other dopants or synthesis techniques to further optimize the material's properties and offer new opportunities for developing materials with enhanced piezoelectric and dielectric properties for advanced technological applications. Lead Barium Niobate (Pb\u2081\u208b\u2093Ba\u2093Nb\u2082O\u2086) ceramics can be synthesized using various methods, like sol-gel , co-precipitation , hydrothermal , molten salt , microwave-assisted , etc., but the most common and efficient approach is the solid-state reaction method. In this study, The PBN ceramics with NdE^{3+} doping were synthesized using the conventional solid-state reaction method. The structural characterization was carried out using X-ray diffraction (XRD) to confirm the formation of the single-phase tetragonal structure. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to analyze the grain morphology and size distribution, while dielectric and piezoelectric properties were measured to evaluate the functional performance of the NdE^{3+} modified PBN ceramics.

# CONCLUSION
Pb\u2081\u208b\u2093\u208b\u2083y/\u2082Ba\u2093Re\u1d67\xb3\u207aNb\u2082O\u2086 ceramics (for x = 0.35 and y = 0.00, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, and Re\xb3\u207a = Nd\xb3\u207a) were successfully synthesized using the solid-state reaction method. The XRD patterns confirmed a single-phase tetragonal structure for undoped PBN (a = 12.505 \xc5, c = 3.984 \xc5) and Nd\xb3\u207a-modified PBN ceramics. The average crystallite size increased gradually with Nd\xb3\u207a substitution, measured as 22.7 nm, 22.6 nm, 23.2 nm, and 25.11 nm for increasing doping levels. SEM images revealed dense, spherical grains with slight morphological deviations as the Nd\xb3\u207a concentration increased. The Curie temperature (Tc) decreased from 350 \xb0C for undoped PBN to 330 \xb0C, 315 \xb0C, and 283 \xb0C with increasing Nd\xb3\u207a content. Regarding piezoelectric properties, the electromechanical coupling factors (k\u209c and k\u209a) increased with Nd\xb3\u207a concentration: k\u209c rose from 0.43 to 0.47, while k\u209a increased from 0.35 to 0.38. However, these values remained slightly lower than those of pure PBN. The piezoelectric charge coefficients d\u2081\u2081 and d\u2083\u2083 also increased with Nd\xb3\u207a content, rising from 125 to 140 pC/N for d\u2081\u2081 and from 170 to 190 pC/N for d\u2083\u2083. Similarly, the mechanical quality factor (Q\u2098) improved from 78 to 90. These findings indicate that Nd\xb3\u207a doping significantly enhances the piezoelectric performance, making Nd\xb3\u207a-modified PBN ceramics promising candidates for high-performance piezoelectric applications, particularly in environments requiring high-temperature stability and improved piezoelectric properties.
