# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The vat photopolymerization additive manufacturing process to produce BCZT ceramics with a tailored pore structure is shown in a. A photosensitive slurry, that was loaded with BCZT powder, was cured using ultraviolet light, as shown in b. Then, the sintered 3D piezoelectric ceramics were poled using corona poling to achieve a piezoelectric response, as shown in e. a shows the effect of the solid content on the viscosity of the BCZT slurry used in the vat photopolymerization process. As the shear rate increased from 10E^{\u22122} to 10E^{2} sE^{\u22121}, the viscosity of the slurries for different solid contents decreased with an increase in shear rate, indicating that the BCZT slurry exhibited shear thinning behavior. In addition, the viscosity of the slurry increased significantly with an increase in BCZT content for shear rate range studied here. At a shear rate of 100 sE^{\u22121}, the viscosity increased from 0.08 to 1.43 Pa s as the solid content increased from 10 to 50 vol%. b shows a schematic of the light intensity distribution when the laser penetrates the ceramic slurry. During the VPP process, the curing depth (C d ) can be described by the Beer-Lambert law, as shown by , while the curing width (C w ) can be described by : where I i and I c are the light intensity at the ceramic slurry surface and the critical energy required to initiate polymerization, respectively. D p is the attenuation length parameter, S is a constant related to the particles scattering efficiency, d is the average diameter of particles, \u03a6 is the solid content in the slurry, n 0 is the refractive index of the resin, \u0394n is the refractive index difference between the ceramic particles and the resin, \u03bb is the wavelength of the laser, and w 0 is the laser beam radius. c shows the curing depths of the slurries with different solid content levels. It can be seen that as the solid content increased from 10 to 40 vol%, the curing depth decreased from 270 to 62 \u03bcm. When the solid content reached 50 vol%, the curing depth was less than 40 \u03bcm, and it could no longer be printed by the VPP process. Therefore, the solid content of the slurries in this work was maintained at 40 vol%. BCZT ceramic powders with different particle size distributions were obtained through ball milling for a range of time periods. d shows that when the milling time increased from 1 to 12 h, the particle size of the powder D 50 decreased from 5 to 1 \u03bcm and the particle size distribution became more narrow The use of a long ball milling time was therefore not only beneficial in reducing the particle size, but was also benefitial to obtaining a uniform particle size distribution. e shows the curing depth with different incident doses (ln (I)) and powders that were ball milled with different time periods. For an incident dose, ln (I), of 6.4 mJ cmE^{\u22122} the curing depth decreased from 80 to 60 \u03bcm for an increase in ball milling time period from 1 to 12 h. When the incident dose was maintained at 600 mJ cmE^{\u22122}, the curing depth increased as the photo-initiator content increased from 0.25 to 1.0 wt% and reached at maximum depth of 62 \u03bcm. When the photo-initiator content increased from 0.25 to 0.5 wt%, the attenuation length parameter increased sharply and reached a maximum of 19.2 \u03bcm. This behavior can be explained by the fact that with an increase in the photo-initiator content for low levels (less than 0.5 wt%), more free radicals will be produced for the same incident dose, which was conducive to the occurrence of polymerization. However, when the initiator content was greater than 0.5 wt%, it began to absorb light thereby hindering its propagation, and D p decreased accordingly. As a result, the curing depth decreased at the same incident dose. i shows the curing width for different incident doses and as the curing dose, ln (I), increased from 5.01 to 6.40 mJ cmE^{\u22122}, the curing width, C w , increased from 237 to 380 \u03bcm. A large curing width is avoided since it would make it difficult to print fine-scale structures, namely smaller than 100 \u03bcm. a shows the thermogravimetry (TG) and differential thermogravimetry (DTG) curves of the green bodies formed by VPP, measured in an argon atmosphere. A weight loss peak can be observed at 425 \u2103 and the sample exhibited no further mass loss after 600 \u2103, indicating that the resin in the sample had completed its pyrolysis process by this temperature. b-f shows optical and SEM images of debinded samples at a range of heating rates. b-c show the top view and side view of the debinded samples for heating rates ranging from 0.1 to 0.3 \u2103 minE^{\u22121}, respectively. The edge of the sample with a low heating rate of 0.1\u2103 minE^{\u22121} appeared white, since the use of a slow heating rate resulted in a longer heating time so that the pyrolytic small molecule substances in the green parts were volatilized. According to the Kelvin equation, the edge of the sample had a higher saturated vapor pressure due to its higher curvature, and the volatilization rate of small molecule substances was higher than that of the inside. d-f are SEM images of sample debinded at different heating rates. There was no apparent deformation of the structure when the heating rate was lower than 0.2 \u2103 minE^{\u22121}. At a higher heating rate of 0.3 \u2103 minE^{\u22121}, the sample exhibited cracks, which can be seen in f, due to more rapid sintering shrinkage. g shows the XRD patterns of samples sintered at different temperatures, where all samples displayed a typical perovskite structure without any apparent impurities. h shows the density and the relative density of samples sintered at different temperatures, and i shows the shrinkage of samples sintered at different temperatures from 1380 to 1440 \u2103. After being sintered at 1420 \u2103, the density and the relative density of samples reached 5.38 g cmE^{\u22123} and 94.46 %, and the shrinkage was 26.54 %. j-m show the cross-sectional morphology of samples sintered at different temperatures after polishing and thermally etching. With an increase in the sintering temperature from 1380 to 1440 \u2103, the average grain size of the ceramics increased from 7.03 to 14.74 \u03bcm, as shown in. When the sintering temperature reached 1440 \u2103, an over-sintering phenomenon was observed, with the growth of abnormal grains and micro-defects were generated , as shown in m, leading to a reduction in density. In summary, the best debinding heating rate is 0.2 \u2103 minE^{\u22121} and the best sintering temperature is 1420 \u2103 to minimise defects formed during debinding and abnormal grain growth during sintering. summarises the properties of BCZT ceramics sintered at different temperatures, ranging from 1380 to 1440 \u2103. a is the polarisation-electric field (P-E) hysteresis loops for BCZT ceramics sintered at different temperatures, where all samples show typical ferroelectric hysteresis characteristics. When the sintering temperature increased from 1380 to 1420 \u2103, the remnant polarization value increased gradually and reached a maximum of 9.93 \u03bcC cmE^{\u22122}. The relative permittivity of the BCZT ceramics reached a maximum of 3300 when sintered at 1420 \u2103, and the dielectric loss (tan \u03b4) of BCZT ceramics reached a minimum of 0.025 at 1420\u2103, as shown in c. d shows the piezoelectric charge constant (d 33 ) of BCZT ceramics sintered at different temperatures. When the sintering temperature increased from 1380 to 1420 \u2103, the d 33 increased gradually and reached a maximum value of \u223c450 pC NE^{\u22121}. The increase in d 33 is associated with larger grain size at higher sintering temperature. As the sintering temperature increased from 1380 to 1420 \u2103, the grain size increased from 7.03 to 11.07 \u03bcm, shown in \u223cc, and the domain size is strongly correlated with the grain size. For BCZT ceramics, when the grain size is less than 10 \u03bcm, the piezoelectricity decreases significantly. The voltage coefficient, g 33 , and energy harvesting figure of merit, FOM 33 = d 33.g 33 , of the BCZT ceramics after sintering at 1420 \u2103 were 15.40 mV m NE^{\u22121} and 6.93 \xd710E^{\u221212} mE^{2} NE^{\u22121} respectively. As the sintering temperature continued to increase to 1440 \u2103, the grain size increased to 14.74 \u03bcm , and the d 33 of the BCZT ceramics decreased to \u223c395 pC NE^{\u22121}. Since the slicing layer thickness of the VPP model structure was 30 \u03bcm, the total thickness of an individual lamella was an integer multiple of 30 \u03bcm. The microstructures of the sintered ceramics with a printed lamella thickness of 60, 90, 120 and 150 \u03bcm are shown in g. All samples were sintered at 1420 \u2103. When the VPP model layer thickness was set to 60 \u03bcm (2 \xd730 \u03bcm), the thickness of the ceramic lamellae after sintering was the thinnest among the four structures and exhibited an clear curvature. When the thickness of the lamellas exceeded 90 \u03bcm (3 \xd730 \u03bcm), the curvature of the ceramic lamellae was reduced. However, when the thickness of the lamellae reached 150 \u03bcm (5 \xd730 \u03bcm), pores and cracks began to appear in the ceramic layer. The relative density of ceramics increased as the thickness of the ceramic layer increased from 60 to 90 \u03bcm. When the VPP model ceramic layer thickness was 90 \u03bcm, the relative density reached a maximum value of \u223c98.02 %. As the thickness of the ceramic layer further increased, where the relative density gradually decreased to 97.42 % when the lamellae thickness was 150 \u03bcm. The densities of the four structures were higher than that of the cylindrical ceramic pellets (94.46 %), shown in h. Due to the large specific area of the ceramic lamellae, a low thickness can facilitate the elimination of pores within individual lamella during the sintering process, thereby improving the densification of the ceramic. i shows the final observable lamellae thickness of sintered ceramics for different initial VPP model lamellae thickness. A minimum ceramic layer thickness of 38 \u03bcm was obtained, which corresponded to an model layer thickness of 60 \u03bcm, i. a is a schematic of the piezoelectric sensor structure based on the aligned lamellar BCZT ceramic. Indium tin oxide (ITO) films were applied on both sides of the aligned lamellar BCZT ceramics by silver adhesive to act as electrodes. The thickness of the lamellae was set to be 90 \u03bcm, since it was shown to exhibit the highest relative density, see h. Piezoelectric ceramic devices with different solid content (64 \u223c 55 vol%) were produced by adjusting the pore channel size. Due to the increase in density of the final ceramic, the overall d 33 of the aligned lamellar ceramics were improved, and the d 33 reached a high value of 513 pC NE^{\u22121} when the pore channel size was 150 \u03bcm. The d 33 coefficient was 1.14 times higher that of printed bulk ceramics (shown in d) and exceeded that of most lead-free piezoelectric ceramics prepared by additive manufacturing technology. With an increase of the pore channel size from 90 to 180 \u03bcm, the relative permittivity of the BCZT ceramics with the aligned lamellar structure decreased from 2430 to 1646, as shown in c. The increase in d 33 and decrease in relative permittivity were beneficial to obtaining a higher g 33 for sensing and a higher FOM 33 = d 33.g 33 for harvesting. As shown in d, when the pore channel size was 150 \u03bcm, the g 33 and FOM 33 of BCZT ceramics reached a maximum value of 32.42 mV m NE^{\u22121} and 16.63\xd710E^{\u221212} mE^{2} NE^{\u22121}, respectively, which were 2.11 and 2.40 times higher than printed bulk ceramics. e shows the comparison of d 33 and \u03b5 r with other barium titanate based piezoelectric ceramics prepared by VPP. The lamella structural design strategy developed here was able to simultaneously achieve a high d 33 of 513 pC NE^{\u22121} and low relative permittivity of 1788. f shows the output values of the open circuit voltage of the device when subject to different pressures. When the pressure increased from 1.25 to 7.5 MPa, the open circuit voltage (\u0394V oc p\u2212p) increased from 33 to 173 V. In addition, the open circuit voltage of the piezoelectric sensor prepared from the dense BCZT ceramic increased from 11.56 to 35.75 V as the applied pressure increased from 1.25 to 7.5 MPa, as shown in. Furthermore, the dynamic pressure sensitivity was calculated by : where A is the effective area (A = 8 mmE^{2}), \u0394V oc p\u2212pand \u0394F are the differences in the open circuit voltage and applied force, respectively. The curve of output voltage and applied force was linearly fitted with the fitting equation of y = 2.75x + 6.00, shown in h, where x is pressure and y is open circuit voltage. The calculated sensitivity of the sensor was \u223c22 V MPaE^{\u22121}. When the applied force exceeded 18.75 MPa, the piezoelectric sensor failed due to the debonding of the conductive silver adhesive.

After electroding the aligned lamellar ceramic with an indium tine oxide film a piezoelectric sensor was obtained which, when subject to a pressure of 7.5 MPa, produced a open circuit voltage of 173 V.

# INTRODUCTION
In the field of sensing, the piezoelectric voltage coefficient (g = d \u03b5 \u03b5 TE^{33}E^{33}E^{0}E^{33}) is typically used to evaluate the sensing properties of materials , where the \u201c33\u201d subscript indicates that the direction of the applied stress is parallel to the direction of polarization. The d 33 term represents the piezoelectric charge coefficient, while \u03b5 E^{ } 33 and \u03b5 0 are the relative permittivity at constant stress and the permittivity of free space, respectively. A high d 33 piezoelectric charge constant and a low permittivity are therefore important to achieve a high piezoelectric voltage coefficient for sensing applications. However, any improvements in the d 33 via this method often leads to an enhancement in the \u03b5 E^{ } 33 , leading to only modest improvements in g 33. By selectively introducing porosity into a piezoelectric ceramic, the \u03b5 E^{ } 33 can be reduced more rapidly than the d 33 , so that the g 33 coefficient can be increased several times higher than its dense counterpart. With the recent developments in additive manufacturing, it is now possible to manufacture materials with an ultrahigh stiffness , adjustable mechanical properties and negative Poisson\u2019s ratio. With the advantages of a high resolution and high printing speed, compared to other additive manufacturing technologies, the technology of vat photopolymerization (VPP) has been employed in the fabrication of a variety of piezoceramics such as lead zirconate titanate (Pb(ZrxTi1-x)O3, PZT) , barium titanate (BaTiO3, BT) and potassium sodium niobate (K0.48Na0.52NbO3, KNN). Smirnov et al. successfully fabricated BT piezoceramics via VPP at a wavelength of 465 nm compared to the conventional 405 nm, achieving a relative density over 95 % and a piezoelectric constant of 148 pC NE^{\u22121}. Liu et al. used a high refractive index monomer acryloyl morpholine (AOMO) to prepare a BT ceramic slurry. The highest relative density and piezoelectric d 33 constant of the BT ceramics formed via VPP and sintering were 95.3 % and 168.1 pC NE^{\u22121}, respectively. Chen et al. demonstrated the formation of a 67 wt% barium titanate/1,6\u2011ethylene glycol diacrylate/polyethylene glycol (400) diacrylate nanocomposites with a high solid content using digital light processing (DLP) 3D printing technology. After sintering, the relative density and piezoelectric d 33 constant of the BT ceramics were 91.69 % and 151 pC NE^{\u22121}, respectively. Using this structural design strategy, the \u03b5 E^{ } 33 was significantly reduced while the d 33 exhibited only a relatively small decrease, leading to the apparent increase in both the piezoelectric voltage coefficient (g 33 ) and the piezoelectric energy harvesting figure of merit (d 33.g 33 ). In this work, lead-free piezoelectric ceramic (Ba0.85Ca0.15)(Zr0.1Ti0.9)O3 (BCZT) was selected as the material due to its lead-free nature and high piezoelectric activity, which is comparable to lead zirconate titanate (PZT). As a result, BCZT lead-free piezoelectric ceramics with high piezoelectric coefficient were obtained by optimizing the debinding and sintering conditions.

# CONCLUSION
Aligned ceramic lamellar structures with a fine-scale layer thickness (38 \u03bcm) were successfully fabricated that are useful for both sensing and energy harvesting applications due its here piezoelectric charge coefficients of low permitivity. The composition and process parameters of the lead-free (Ba0.85Ca0.15)(Zr0.1Ti0.9)O3 photosensitive ceramic slurry for vat photopolymerization (VPP) were optimized and evaluated in detail. The optimized content of photo-initiator was 1 wt%, the corresponding incident light dose was 600 mJ cmE^{\u22122}, and the curing depth was 62 \u03bcm. The BCZT ceramics sintered at 1420\u2103 showed excellent ferroelectric, piezoelectric, and dielectric properties, with a d 33 = 450 pC NE^{\u22121}, \u03b5 r = 3300, tan \u03b4 = 0.03, and P r = 9.92 \u03bcC cmE^{\u22122}. Since the curing depth could be freely controlled by the VPP process, aligned lamellar structures were prepared and examined, where the minimum characteristic size of the lamella was 38 \u03bcm. The optimized piezoelectric ceramic devices showed improved electrical properties compared to the bulk ceramics, with d 33 = 513 pC NE^{\u22121}, \u03b5 r = 1788, tan \u03b4 = 0.03, g 33 = 32.42 mV m NE^{\u22121}, and FOM 33 = 16.63\xd710E^{\u221212} mE^{2} NE^{\u22121}. After electroding the aligned lamellar ceramic with an indium tin oxide film a piezoelectric sensor was obtained which, when subject to a pressure of 7.5 MPa, was able to produce a high \u0394V oc p\u2212p of 173 V.

The vat photopolymerization additive manufacturing process to produce BCZT ceramics with a tailored pore structure is shown in a. A photosensitive slurry, that was loaded with BCZT powder, was cured using ultraviolet light, as shown in b. Then, the sintered 3D piezoelectric ceramics were poled using corona poling to achieve a piezoelectric response, as shown in e. a shows the effect of the solid content on the viscosity of the BCZT slurry used in the vat photopolymerization process.

In addition, the viscosity of the slurry increased significantly with an increase in BCZT content for shear rate range studied here. At a shear rate of 100 sE^{\u22121}, the viscosity increased from 0.08 to 1.43 Pa s as the solid content increased from 10 to 50 vol%. b shows a schematic of the light intensity distribution when the laser penetrates the ceramic slurry. During the VPP process, the curing depth (C d ) can be described by the Beer-Lambert law, as shown by , while the curing width (C w ) can be described by : where I i and I c are the light intensity at the ceramic slurry surface and the critical energy required to initiate polymerization, respectively. D p is the attenuation length parameter, S is a constant related to the particles scattering efficiency, d is the average diameter of particles, \u03a6 is the solid content in the slurry, n 0 is the refractive index of the resin, \u0394n is the refractive index difference between the ceramic particles and the resin, \u03bb is the wavelength of the laser, and w 0 is the laser beam radius. c shows the curing depths of the slurries with different solid content levels. It can be seen that as the solid content increased from 10 to 40 vol%, the curing depth decreased from 270 to 62 \u03bcm. When the solid content reached 50 vol%, the curing depth was less than 40 \u03bcm, and it could no longer be printed by the VPP process. Therefore, the solid content of the slurries in this work was maintained at 40 vol%. BCZT ceramic powders with different particle size distributions were obtained through ball milling for a range of time periods. d shows that when the milling time increased from 1 to 12 h, the particle size of the powder D 50 decreased from 5 to 1 \u03bcm and the particle size distribution became more narrow The use of a long ball milling time was therefore not only beneficial in reducing the particle size, but was also benefitial to obtaining a uniform particle size distribution. e shows the curing depth with different incident doses (ln (I)) and powders that were ball milled with different time periods. For an incident dose, ln (I), of 6.4 mJ cmE^{\u22122} the curing depth decreased from 80 to 60 \u03bcm for an increase in ball milling time period from 1 to 12 h. When the incident dose was maintained at 600 mJ cmE^{\u22122}, the curing depth increased as the photo-initiator content increased from 0.25 to 1.0 wt% and reached at maximum depth of 62 \u03bcm. When the photo-initiator content increased from 0.25 to 0.5 wt%, the attenuation length parameter increased sharply and reached a maximum of 19.2 \u03bcm. This behavior can be explained by the fact that with an increase in the photo-initiator content for low levels (less than 0.5 wt%), more free radicals will be produced for the same incident dose, which was conducive to the occurrence of polymerization. However, when the initiator content was greater than 0.5 wt%, it began to absorb light thereby hindering its propagation, and D p decreased accordingly. As a result, the curing depth decreased at the same incident dose. i shows the curing width for different incident doses and as the curing dose, ln (I), increased from 5.01 to 6.40 mJ cmE^{\u22122}, the curing width, C w , increased from 237 to 380 \u03bcm. A large curing width is avoided since it would make it difficult to print fine-scale structures, namely smaller than 100 \u03bcm. a shows the thermogravimetry (TG) and differential thermogravimetry (DTG) curves of the green bodies formed by VPP, measured in an argon atmosphere. A weight loss peak can be observed at 425 \u2103 and the sample exhibited no further mass loss after 600 \u2103, indicating that the resin in the sample had completed its pyrolysis process by this temperature. b-f shows optical and SEM images of debinded samples at a range of heating rates. b-c show the top view and side view of the debinded samples for heating rates ranging from 0.1 to 0.3 \u2103 minE^{\u22121}, respectively. The edge of the sample with a low heating rate of 0.1\u2103 minE^{\u22121} appeared white, since the use of a slow heating rate resulted in a longer heating time so that the pyrolytic small molecule substances in the green parts were volatilized. According to the Kelvin equation, the edge of the sample had a higher saturated vapor pressure due to its higher curvature, and the volatilization rate of small molecule substances was higher than that of the inside. d-f are SEM images of sample debinded at different heating rates. There was no apparent deformation of the structure when the heating rate was lower than 0.2 \u2103 minE^{\u22121}. At a higher heating rate of 0.3 \u2103 minE^{\u22121}, the sample exhibited cracks, which can be seen in f, due to more rapid sintering shrinkage. g shows the XRD patterns of samples sintered at different temperatures, where all samples displayed a typical perovskite structure without any apparent impurities. h shows the density and the relative density of samples sintered at different temperatures, and i shows the shrinkage of samples sintered at different temperatures from 1380 to 1440 \u2103. After being sintered at 1420 \u2103, the density and the relative density of samples reached 5.38 g cmE^{\u22123} and 94.46 %, and the shrinkage was 26.54 %. j-m show the cross-sectional morphology of samples sintered at different temperatures after polishing and thermally etching. With an increase in the sintering temperature from 1380 to 1440 \u2103, the average grain size of the ceramics increased from 7.03 to 14.74 \u03bcm, as shown in. When the sintering temperature reached 1440 \u2103, an over-sintering phenomenon was observed, with the growth of abnormal grains and micro-defects were generated , as shown in m, leading to a reduction in density. In summary, the best debinding heating rate is 0.2 \u2103 minE^{\u22121} and the best sintering temperature is 1420 \u2103 to minimise defects formed during debinding and abnormal grain growth during sintering. summarises the properties of BCZT ceramics sintered at different temperatures, ranging from 1380 to 1440 \u2103. a is the polarisation-electric field (P-E) hysteresis loops for BCZT ceramics sintered at different temperatures, where all samples show typical ferroelectric hysteresis characteristics. When the sintering temperature increased from 1380 to 1420 \u2103, the remnant polarization value increased gradually and reached a maximum of 9.93 \u03bcC cmE^{\u22122}. The relative permittivity of the BCZT ceramics reached a maximum of 3300 when sintered at 1420 \u2103, and the dielectric loss (tan \u03b4) of BCZT ceramics reached a minimum of 0.025 at 1420\u2103, as shown in c. d shows the piezoelectric charge constant (d 33 ) of BCZT ceramics sintered at different temperatures. When the sintering temperature increased from 1380 to 1420 \u2103, the d 33 increased gradually and reached a maximum value of \u223c450 pC NE^{\u22121}. The increase in d 33 is associated with larger grain size at higher sintering temperature. As the sintering temperature increased from 1380 to 1420 \u2103, the grain size increased from 7.03 to 11.07 \u03bcm, shown in \u223cc, and the domain size is strongly correlated with the grain size. For BCZT ceramics, when the grain size is less than 10 \u03bcm, the piezoelectricity decreases significantly. The voltage coefficient, g 33 , and energy harvesting figure of merit, FOM 33 = d 33.g 33 , of the BCZT ceramics after sintering at 1420 \u2103 were 15.40 mV m NE^{\u22121} and 6.93 \xd710E^{\u221212} mE^{2} NE^{\u22121} respectively. As the sintering temperature continued to increase to 1440 \u2103, the grain size increased to 14.74 \u03bcm , and the d 33 of the BCZT ceramics decreased to \u223c395 pC NE^{\u22121}. Since the slicing layer thickness of the VPP model structure was 30 \u03bcm, the total thickness of an individual lamella was an integer multiple of 30 \u03bcm. The microstructures of the sintered ceramics with a printed lamella thickness of 60, 90, 120 and 150 \u03bcm are shown in g. All samples were sintered at 1420 \u2103. When the VPP model layer thickness was set to 60 \u03bcm (2 \xd730 \u03bcm), the thickness of the ceramic lamellae after sintering was the thinnest among the four structures and exhibited an clear curvature. When the thickness of the lamellas exceeded 90 \u03bcm (3 \xd730 \u03bcm), the curvature of the ceramic lamellae was reduced. However, when the thickness of the lamellae reached 150 \u03bcm (5 \xd730 \u03bcm), pores and cracks began to appear in the ceramic layer. The relative density of ceramics increased as the thickness of the ceramic layer increased from 60 to 90 \u03bcm. When the VPP model ceramic layer thickness was 90 \u03bcm, the relative density reached a maximum value of \u223c98.02 %. As the thickness of the ceramic layer further increased, where the relative density gradually decreased to 97.42 % when the lamellae thickness was 150 \u03bcm. The densities of the four structures were higher than that of the cylindrical ceramic pellets (94.46 %), shown in h. Due to the large specific area of the ceramic lamellae, a low thickness can facilitate the elimination of pores within individual lamella during the sintering process, thereby improving the densification of the ceramic. i shows the final observable lamellae thickness of sintered ceramics for different initial VPP model lamellae thickness. A minimum ceramic layer thickness of 38 \u03bcm was obtained, which corresponded to an model layer thickness of 60 \u03bcm, i. a is a schematic of the piezoelectric sensor structure based on the aligned lamellar BCZT ceramic. Indium tin oxide (ITO) films were applied on both sides of the aligned lamellar BCZT ceramics by silver adhesive to act as electrodes. The thickness of the lamellae was set to be 90 \u03bcm, since it was shown to exhibit the highest relative density, see h. Piezoelectric ceramic devices with different solid content (64 \u223c 55 vol%) were produced by adjusting the pore channel size. Due to the increase in density of the final ceramic, the overall d 33 of the aligned lamellar ceramics were improved, and the d 33 reached a high value of 513 pC NE^{\u22121} when the pore channel size was 150 \u03bcm. The d 33 coefficient was 1.14 times higher that of printed bulk ceramics (shown in d) and exceeded that of most lead-free piezoelectric ceramics prepared by additive manufacturing technology. With an increase of the pore channel size from 90 to 180 \u03bcm, the relative permittivity of the BCZT ceramics with the aligned lamellar structure decreased from 2430 to 1646, as shown in c. The increase in d 33 and decrease in relative permittivity were beneficial to obtaining a higher g 33 for sensing and a higher FOM 33 = d 33.g 33 for harvesting. As shown in d, when the pore channel size was 150 \u03bcm, the g 33 and FOM 33 of BCZT ceramics reached a maximum value of 32.42 mV m NE^{\u22121} and 16.63\xd710E^{\u221212} mE^{2} NE^{\u22121}, respectively, which were 2.11 and 2.40 times higher than printed bulk ceramics. e shows the comparison of d 33 and \u03b5 r with other barium titanate based piezoelectric ceramics prepared by VPP. The lamella structural design strategy developed here was able to simultaneously achieve a high d 33 of 513 pC NE^{\u22121} and low relative permittivity of 1788. f shows the output values of the open circuit voltage of the device when subject to different pressures. When the pressure increased from 1.25 to 7.5 MPa, the open circuit voltage (\u0394V oc p\u2212p) increased from 33 to 173 V. In addition, the open circuit voltage of the piezoelectric sensor prepared from the dense BCZT ceramic increased from 11.56 to 35.75 V as the applied pressure increased from 1.25 to 7.5 MPa, as shown in. Furthermore, the dynamic pressure sensitivity was calculated by : where A is the effective area (A = 8 mmE^{2}), \u0394V oc p\u2212pand \u0394F are the differences in the open circuit voltage and applied force, respectively. The curve of output voltage and applied force was linearly fitted with the fitting equation of y = 2.75x + 6.00, shown in h, where x is pressure and y is open circuit voltage. The calculated sensitivity of the sensor was \u223c22 V MPaE^{\u22121}. When the applied force exceeded 18.75 MPa, the piezoelectric sensor failed due to the debonding of the conductive silver adhesive.

# INTRODUCTION
In the field of sensing, the piezoelectric voltage coefficient (g = d \u03b5 \u03b5 TE^{33}E^{33}E^{0}E^{33}) is typically used to evaluate the sensing properties of materials , where the \u201c33\u201d subscript indicates that the direction of the applied stress is parallel to the direction of polarization. The d 33 term represents the piezoelectric charge coefficient, while \u03b5 E^{ } 33 and \u03b5 0 are the relative permittivity at constant stress and the permittivity of free space, respectively. A high d 33 piezoelectric charge constant and a low permittivity are therefore important to achieve a high piezoelectric voltage coefficient for sensing applications. However, any improvements in the d 33 via this method often leads to an enhancement in the \u03b5 E^{ } 33 , leading to only modest improvements in g 33. By selectively introducing porosity into a piezoelectric ceramic, the \u03b5 E^{ } 33 can be reduced more rapidly than the d 33 , so that the g 33 coefficient can be increased several times higher than its dense counterpart. With the recent developments in additive manufacturing, it is now possible to manufacture materials with an ultrahigh stiffness , adjustable mechanical properties and negative Poisson\u2019s ratio. With the advantages of a high resolution and high printing speed, compared to other additive manufacturing technologies, the technology of vat photopolymerization (VPP) has been employed in the fabrication of a variety of piezoceramics such as lead zirconate titanate (Pb(ZrxTi1-x)O3, PZT) , barium titanate (BaTiO3, BT) and potassium sodium niobate (K0.48Na0.52NbO3, KNN). Smirnov et al. successfully fabricated BT piezoceramics via VPP at a wavelength of 465 nm compared to the conventional 405 nm, achieving a relative density over 95 % and a piezoelectric constant of 148 pC NE^{\u22121}. Liu et al. used a high refractive index monomer acryloyl morpholine (AOMO) to prepare a BT ceramic slurry. The highest relative density and piezoelectric d 33 constant of the BT ceramics formed via VPP and sintering were 95.3 % and 168.1 pC NE^{\u22121}, respectively. Chen et al. demonstrated the formation of a 67 wt% barium titanate/1,6\u2011ethylene glycol diacrylate/polyethylene glycol (400) diacrylate nanocomposites with a high solid content using digital light processing (DLP) 3D printing technology. After sintering, the relative density and piezoelectric d 33 constant of the BT ceramics were 91.69 % and 151 pC NE^{\u22121}, respectively. Using this structural design strategy, the \u03b5 E^{ } 33 was significantly reduced while the d 33 exhibited only a relatively small decrease, leading to the apparent increase in both the piezoelectric voltage coefficient (g 33 ) and the piezoelectric energy harvesting figure of merit (d 33.g 33 ). In this work, lead-free piezoelectric ceramic (Ba0.85Ca0.15)(Zr0.1Ti0.9)O3 (BCZT) was selected as the material due to its lead-free nature and high piezoelectric activity, which is comparable to lead zirconate titanate (PZT). As a result, BCZT lead-free piezoelectric ceramics with high piezoelectric coefficient were obtained by optimizing the debinding and sintering conditions.

# CONCLUSION
Aligned ceramic lamellar structures with a fine-scale layer thickness (38 \u03bcm) were successfully fabricated that are useful for both sensing and energy harvesting applications due its here piezoelectric charge coefficients of low permitivity. The composition and process parameters of the lead-free (Ba0.85Ca0.15)(Zr0.1Ti0.9)O3 photosensitive ceramic slurry for vat photopolymerization (VPP) were optimized and evaluated in detail. The optimized content of photo-initiator was 1 wt%, the corresponding incident light dose was 600 mJ cmE^{\u22122}, and the curing depth was 62 \u03bcm. The BCZT ceramics sintered at 1420\u2103 showed excellent ferroelectric, piezoelectric, and dielectric properties, with a d 33 = 450 pC NE^{\u22121}, \u03b5 r = 3300, tan \u03b4 = 0.03, and P r = 9.92 \u03bcC cmE^{\u22122}. Since the curing depth could be freely controlled by the VPP process, aligned lamellar structures were prepared and examined, where the minimum characteristic size of the lamella was 38 \u03bcm. The optimized piezoelectric ceramic devices showed improved electrical properties compared to the bulk ceramics, with d 33 = 513 pC NE^{\u22121}, \u03b5 r = 1788, tan \u03b4 = 0.03, g 33 = 32.42 mV m NE^{\u22121}, and FOM 33 = 16.63\xd710E^{\u221212} mE^{2} NE^{\u22121}. After electroding the aligned lamellar ceramic with an indium tin oxide film a piezoelectric sensor was obtained which, when subject to a pressure of 7.5 MPa, was able to produce a high \u0394V oc p\u2212p of 173 V.
