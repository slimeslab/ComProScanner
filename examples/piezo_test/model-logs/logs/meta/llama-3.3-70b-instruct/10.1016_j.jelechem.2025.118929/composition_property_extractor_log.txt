# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The preparation procedure for LiTaO3-modified LiCoO2 (LTO-LCO) is illustrated in a, a simple sol\u2013gel method coupled with thermal treatment was utilized to coat LTO onto LCO uniformly. A modification mechanism was proposed based on the synergistic effect of physical isolation and piezoelectricity of the LTO coating layer on LCO. The lattice volume expansion of LCO accompanied the charging and discharging processes, then its stress was imparted onto LTO, leading to its piezoelectric polarization. To ascertain that the coating layer was indeed LTO, pure LTO powder was synthesized using the same preparation methodology employed in the fabrication of LTO-LCO. An XRD pattern with Rietveld refinement data (b) confirms that the synthesized material is pure LTO without other impurities. Characterization via Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), as illustrated in c, revealed that the LTO particles exhibited a uniform size distribution, with diameters averaging approximately 100 nm. The piezoelectric properties of pure LTO were also assessed, as summarized in a. LTO exhibits characteristic features of piezoelectric materials, with a piezoelectric coefficient (d 33) of 8 pC NE^{\u22121}, a dielectric constant (\u03b5 r) of 96.5, a capacitance (C) of 43 pF, and dielectric loss (tan\u03b4) of 0.06. b and 2c present the hysteresis loops of STO and MTO under diverse applied electric fields. For STO, the Pr value was approximately 0.26 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at 1 kV/mm, rose to about 0.67 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at 2 kV/mm, and reached around 1 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at 3 kV/mm. Similarly, for MTO, the Pr value began at roughly 0.006 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at 1 kV/mm, climbed to nearly 0.018 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at 2 kV/mm, and trended towards 0.031 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at 3 kV/mm. The XRD patterns of the synthetic sample powders with different coating contents were tested, as shown in a. No matter whether before and after coated LCO, the main diffraction peaks corresponding to (003), (101), and (104) planes indicate a hexagonal layered \u03b1-NaFeO2 structure with space group R-3 m (PDF#70\u20132685). The stable peak positions indicated that LTO modification did not alter the original crystal structure of LCO. Concurrently, as the LTO content increased, its diffraction peak became sharper, with a more pronounced differentiation of the (006)/(012) double peaks, indicating enhanced crystallinity and a more ordered layered structure. Rietveld refinement of the XRD shown in a and , and the refined data  confirm no apparent crystal change for LTO and LCO. S(2) of lattice mismatch, the lattice mismatch between LCO and LTO is as low as 2.13 %, indicating that the LTO coating layer and LCO material have excellent interface compatibility. SEM images (as depicted in b) reveal that the surface of the pristine LCO particle is smooth. In contrast, post-coating powders particles appeared on the surface of LCO grains, and the surface became coarser with the increased amount of coating layer. However, the particle size of LCO grains has no significant alteration, maintaining at approximately 5 \u03bcm, suggesting quite a thin LTO coating layer. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was employed to further investigate the thickness and uniformity of the coating layer across different content. As illustrated in c, the thickness of the coating layer shows a clear linear growth trend, increasing from 3.5 nm to 6.5 nm, and 10.5 nm with LTO coating amounts of 1 wt% to 3 wt%, respectively. In the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image of the 2 wt% LTO-LCO sample (d), the interface structure between the LCO matrix and the LTO coating was displayed. Lattice fringes corresponding to the (012) plane with an average spacing of 0.23 nm were identified, while heteroepitaxial lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.21 nm were attributed to the (202) plane of LTO. The HRTEM image revealed excellent interfacial bonding between the LTO coating and the LCO matrix, with no noticeable interfacial defects or gaps observed. This tight interfacial bonding facilitated the stabilization of the electrode\u2013electrolyte interface, thereby promoting efficient LiE^{+} migration. Furthermore, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis was performed on the 2 wt% LTO-LCO sample, as shown in e, to reveal the uniform distribution of Ta, Co elements on the LCO surface. The uniform presence of Ta indicates that the LTO coating layer was uniformly deposited on the surface of the LCO particles. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to investigate the surface elemental composition and valence state distribution of LTO-LCO samples. The spectra were standardized using the C 1 s peak at 284.8 eV, as depicted in and. The full spectra of LCO, 1 wt%, 2 wt%, and 3 wt% LTO-LCO show five main peaks at about 55, 284, 531, 684, and 780 eV, as shown in a and S1a, which correspond to the Li 1 s, C 1 s, O 1 s, F 1 s, and Co 2p spectra, respectively. The peaks at approximately 27.5 and 25.6 eV likely originate from the Ta 4f5/2 and Ta 4f7/2 spin\u2013orbit doublet of the TaE^{5+} oxidation state in the LTO coating (as illustrated in b), which emerges only after the coating process. In c and S2b-c, the XPS spectra display the Co 2p region for LCO samples before and after LTO coating. The binding energies of Co 2p1/2 and Co 2p3/2 were located around 795 eV and 780 eV, respectively, indicating that the LTO coating layer did not induce rehybridization of the Co 2p orbitals, thus maintaining a relatively stable chemical environment for cobalt. In addition, d displays the O 1 s spectra of LCO and 2 wt% LTO-LCO samples after 100 cycles. As depicted, the three peaks between 528 eV and 535 eV reflect the lattice oxygen peak, the oxygen vacancy peak, and the adsorbed oxygen peak, respectively. The lattice oxygen contents for LCO and 2 wt% LTO-LCO samples were determined to be 38.57 % and 49.64 %, respectively. This suggests that the LTO layer inhibits the oxidation of lattice oxygen at high voltages, thereby stabilizing the crystal structure of LCO and suppressing the formation of byproducts on the surface of LCO particles. The content of the adsorbed oxygen peak located around 532 eV shows an apparent decrease after LTO coating. This means that the LTO layer can be used as a protective barrier to prevent the adsorption of oxygen molecules and thus reduce the degree of surface oxidation for the LCO cathode material. From the C 1 s spectrum in e, the content percentage of Li2CO3 peak reduced by 3.87 % from 15.59 % of LCO to 11.72 % of 2 wt% LTO-LCO. The COC peak content percentage decreased by 7.07 % from LCO to 2 wt% LTO-LCO. This may be attributed to effectively isolating the electrolyte from physical contact with LCO by the LTO coating layer, thereby reducing the alkaline content on the surface of LCO particles. As depicted in f, the F 1 s spectrum was divided into three peaks, corresponding to C-F, LiF, and LixPOyFz/LixPFy, respectively. From the pristine LCO to 2 wt% LTO-LCO, the LixPOyFz/LixPFy peak disappeared, and the LiF peak content also decreased. This also means that the LTO coating layer reduces the physical contact between the electrolyte and LCO, thereby decreasing the decomposition of the LiPF6 component. Herein, LTO as a coating layer can effectively inhibit the occurrence of side reactions. To investigate the impact of piezoelectric LTO coating layer for the electrochemical performance of LCO, the charge\u2013discharge process of LCO samples before and after LTO coating were evaluated within a voltage range of 3.0 to 4.5 V. a depicts the cycling performance and coulomb efficiency curves of pristine LCO, 1 wt%, 2 wt%, and 3 wt% LTO-LCO samples at 0.1 C. The pristine LCO sample deteriorated at the 142nd cycle. The charge\u2013discharge cycles lead to repeated expansion and contraction of the crystal structure of LCO samples, which causes the accumulation of mechanical stress in LCO, resulting in capacity fade. As shown in , the surfaces of the original LCO grains were affected by cracks caused by stress resulting from long-term cycling. In contrast, the LCO grains coated with LTO exhibited a significant reduction in stress-induced expansion. In the TEM image of the 2 wt% LTO-LCO sample after long-term cycling , the interface structure between the LCO matrix and the LTO coating was displayed. Excellent interfacial bonding between the LTO coating and the LCO matrix was observed, with no noticeable interfacial defects or gaps. The results show that the LTO coating is not damaged by the stress during the long-term cycle and maintains good integrity. After 200 cycles, the 2 wt% LTO-LCO sample maintained a high discharge specific capacity of 172.8 mAh\xb7gE^{\u22121} and a good capacity retention rate of 84.8 %. In addition, as illustrated in b, the 2 wt% LTO-LCO sample testing at different rates also exhibited the highest discharge-specific capacities compared with the reference samples. For example, it maintained a capacity of 135.8 mAh\xb7gE^{\u22121} at a rate of 5 C and a capacity of 194.5 mAh\xb7gE^{\u22121} with the rate restored from 5 C to 0.1 C (97.3 % capacity retention rate). c displays the first charge\u2013discharge curves for all testing samples. It can be observed that the use of the LTO coating layer can improve the initial Coulombic efficiency of the LCO electrode. The 2 wt% LTO-LCO sample exhibited a high initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 76.73 %, significantly surpassing the pristine LCO (28.46 %). As can be observed from d and 5e, and e and S3f, voltage decay occurred as the number of cycles increased, related to the structural phase transitions and interfacial side reactions of LCO. During the charging process, an ordered-to-disordered transition occurred in the LCO samples when the voltage reached approximately 4.2 V, leading to fluctuations of the voltage drop in the charging curve. At a charging voltage of 4.5 V, a phase transition from the O3 phase to the H1-3 phase occurred, causing a capacity fade in the LCO samples. It can be observed that the pristine LCO sample exhibited fluctuations in the curve at positions of 4.10 and 4.18 V, while these fluctuations gradually disappeared for LTO coating samples. In addition, g-h and a-b present the first three cycles of CV curves for the four samples. It can be observed that the pristine LCO sample exhibited fluctuations in the curve at 4.18 V, whereas the LTO-coated samples did not show this phenomenon. The redox peaks remained unchanged, indicating that the LTO coating layer did not alter the structure of LCO, effectively extending the cycling life of LCO. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of LTO-LCO electrodes were conducted to further analyze the impact of the LTO coating layer on LiE^{+} diffusion kinetics. a-b and S3c-d present the CV curves at the 0th, 3rd, 50th, and 100th cycles for LTO-LCO electrode testing at a scan rate of 0.2 mV\xb7sE^{\u22121}. For pristine LCO electrodes, the intensity of the redox peaks decreased sharply, and the half-widths increased gradually with the increase of cycle numbers. However, for the 2 wt% LTO-LCO electrode, the intensity of the redox peaks strengthened, and the half-widths narrowed with the rise in cycle numbers. Furthermore, the CV curves were obtained with scan rates from 0.3 to 0.6 mV\xb7sE^{\u22121} within the 3.0\u20134.5 V voltage range, as illustrated in c-d, and g-h. For both of pristine LCO and 2 wt% LTO-LCO electrodes, their redox peak potentials shifted to both sides with the increased scan rates, indicating the polarization phenomenon of the battery. The linear relationship between the scan rate and the peak current in the CV curves was fitted by the Randles-Sevcik equation. As illustrated in e-f, the 2 wt% LTO-LCO electrode shows the highest slope among all the samples. Then the lithium-ion diffusion coefficients (DLi+) corresponding to the redox peaks of LTO-LCO electrodes were calculated using eq. S(3) , as depicted in g. The detailed DLi+ values are shown in and the 2 wt%LTO-LCO electrode exhibits the highest DLi+. Although the LTO coating layer does not provide battery electrode capacity, it enhances the LiE^{+} diffusion coefficient. h-i depict the Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) for LTO-LCO electrode testing at the first and the 200 cycles. The 2 wt% LTO-LCO samples exhibited the smallest solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) impedances (Rsf) for both the first and the 200 cycles, indicating the lowest impedance for LiE^{+} transport through the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). This suggests that the LTO coating layer reduced the direct contact between the LCO material and the electrolyte, thereby decreasing the occurrence of side reactions. Interestingly, the impedance values of 2 wt% LTO-LCO samples decreased gradually with cycle counts from the first to 200 cycles , which may be attributed to the fact that the piezoelectric properties of the LTO coating layer accelerated the diffusion rate of LiE^{+} at the electrolyte interface and formed a more stable and reliable electrolyte interface. The XPS spectra of the Bare LCO and 2 wt% LTO-LCO samples after 100 cycles are shown in. It was demonstrated that the LTO coating significantly suppressed the generation of side reactions at the electrode interface and the decomposition of the electrolyte. This effect facilitated easier LiE^{+} migration, thereby validating the role of LTO in regulating LiE^{+} behavior. In addition, low-temperature STO and MTO were studied as coatings for LCO electrodes. S(2) (see ), the lattice mismatch between MTO and LCO is small, while the lattice mismatch between STO and LCO is large. However, TEM analysis shows that STO and MTO cover the LCO interface, as shown in. The increase in electrochemical performance verifies the general applicability of ferroelectric coatings in converting the stresses generated during the LCO high-voltage charging-discharge cycle into polarized fields, thereby increasing the diffusion rate of LiE^{+}. shows the cycling and rate performance curves of STO-LCO and MTO-LCO electrodes with different contents as coating layers, tested in the voltage range of 3.0\u20134.5 V. The cycling and rate performance of the LCO electrodes were significantly improved after being coated with 1 wt% STO and MTO materials. This confirmed the general applicability of these materials in improving the performance of LCO. However, the performance of the LCO electrodes coated with LTO was even higher, indicating that while both STO and MTO coatings could improve the electrochemical performance of LCO, the LTO coating exhibited superior performance in terms of cycle stability and rate capability. The improved performance of the LTO-coated LCO can be attributed to its stronger spontaneous polarization and better piezoelectric properties, which more effectively converted the stress generated during high-pressure charging and discharging into a polarizing electric field. By studying the theoretical and experimental results in the existing literature , we propose a mechanism to explain how LTO coatings improve the electrochemical properties of the positive electrode of LCO. The modification mechanism of piezoelectric and ferroelectric coatings on LCO electrodes is illustrated in. During the charge\u2013discharge cycles, the insertion and extraction of LiE^{+} ions caused lattice expansion and a series of phase transitions in the LCO electrode, leading to stress\u2013strain accumulation. During the charging process, the extraction of lithium ions induced lattice expansion in the LCO electrode, generating stress that was subsequently transferred to the piezoelectric and ferroelectric coatings. These coatings then produced polarization fields opposite the direction of the stress and the LiE^{+} transport direction, preventing overcharging of the LCO electrode. In the discharging process, the stress on the coatings began to decrease, causing the polarization fields to align with the external electric field, which facilitated the insertion of LiE^{+} into the LCO electrode. At this stage, the polarization field acts as an accelerator for LiE^{+}, thereby enhancing the electrochemical performance of LCO. In summary, since the piezoelectric and ferroelectric coatings do not contribute to charge\u2013discharge capacity, the enhancement of the LCO electrode's electrochemical performance can be attributed to: 1) the reduction of physical contact between LCO and the electrolyte by the piezoelectric and ferroelectric coatings, thereby reducing the occurrence of interfacial side reactions; 2) the formation of a polarization field by the piezoelectric and ferroelectric coatings, which regulates the insertion and extraction of LiE^{+} during cycling, thus suppressing the ordered-to-disordered phase transition and mitigating the structural degradation of LCO.

# TITLE
Low-temperature piezoelectric/ferroelectric coating layer driving lithium-ion rapid diffusion and structure stability of LiCoO<inf>2</inf> cathode

# ABSTRACT
The increase in charging cut-off voltage accelerates the structure degradation and stress–strain accumulation of LiCoO2 (LCO) cathode, leading to heightened side reactions on the electrode surface and ultimately diminishing its electrochemical performance. Here, the piezoelectric LiTaO3 (LTO) and ferroelectric SrTiO3 (STO), and MgTiO3 (MTO) show matched preparation temperature with LCO electrode, which were utilized as coating layers to transform the stress and strain experienced during the high-voltage charging and discharging processes into polarization fields, thereby enhancing the electrochemical functionality. Taking the LTO coating layer as an example, the 2 wt% LTO-LCO electrode exhibits an obvious elevation of electrochemical, achieving 172.8 mAh·g−1 at 0.1 C (135.8 mAh·g−1 at 5 C) and maintaining a capacity retention rate of 84.8 % (1 C = 274 mAh·g−1, 3.0–4.5 V) after 200 cycles. This research proves that the low-temperature piezoelectric/ferroelectric materials can be used as a coating layer of LCO electrodes to transform the stress and strain into polarization fields, which reduce the lattice expansion and accelerate the Li+ transport for designing high-performance LCO batteries in the future.

# INTRODUCTION
With the rapid progression of renewable energy, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) with high energy densities have been extensively employed in power storage systems, electric vehicles, and portable electronic devices. As a pivotal cathode material for lithium batteries, LiCoO2 (LCO) garnered significant attention due to its high energy density, exceptional cyclic stability, and elevated voltage platform. The theoretical specific capacity of LCO cathode material is 274 mAh\xb7gE^{\u22121}, but its practical specific capacity, measured at 4.2 V, stands at approximately 140 mAh\xb7gE^{\u22121}, representing merely 50 % of its theoretical potential. In recent decades, the operational voltage of LCO increased from 4.2 V to 4.4 V, which corresponds with the practical capacity at this voltage typically amounting to roughly 60 % of the theoretical capacity. However, high voltage also means a high degree of delithiation, and the insertion and extraction of LiE^{+} during cycling can cause lattice expansion and a series of phase transitions, leading to significant stress\u2013strain accumulation in the crystal structure. Simultaneously, side reactions between the cathode material and the electrolyte increased, along with issues such as lattice oxygen loss, which led to a rapid decline in the cycling capacity of the LCO cathode material. With the introduction of metal oxide (Co3O4 , ZrO2 , TiO2 , etc.), metal fluoride (CaF2 , AlF3 , etc.), and fast ion conductor (Li2ZrO3 , LiVO3 , LiAlO2 , etc.) and other materials for covering, which not only reduces the side reactions between the particle surface of electrode material and the electrolyte using as physical isolation but also improves the efficiency of LiE^{+} diffusion. For example, Zhou et al. prepared Al2O3 nanoparticles as a coating layer of the LCO cathode and demonstrated a capacity retention rate of 82.6 % after 500 cycles at 1 C. Dai et al. prepared a CaF2-coated NCM811 sample by a simple wet chemical method. They showed a specific discharge capacity of 192.8 mAh\xb7gE^{\u22121} and coulomb efficiency of 86.42 %, which reduced the occurrence of side reactions, however, they did not improve the LiE^{+} diffusion efficiency. Song et al. prepared Li2ZrO3 coated LiNi0.7Co0.15Mn0.15O2 samples by sol\u2013gel method and precipitation method, and the capacity retention rate of the whole battery assembled by this method was 73.3 % after 1500 cycles at C/3 ratio. On the other hand, the stress generated by lithium-ion decoupling during the charge\u2013discharge cycle can also be converted into an internal polarization field. Recently, some LIB electrode materials have been modified using piezoelectric or ferroelectric as coating layers to transform the internal stress into polarization fields. For example, Ma et al. designed a diaphragm coating layer with BaTiO3, its piezoelectric property accelerates the redox kinetics of lithium-sulfur batteries and constructs the built-in electric field to improve the LiE^{+} transport, achieving a high-capacity retention rate after 400 cycles at 1 C. Lee et al. also proved that the composited silicon and BaTiO3 anodes can build a local electric field to improve the diffusion efficiency of LiE^{+}. However, the synthesis temperature of BaTiO3 typically exceeds 850 \xb0C, which can cause the thermal decomposition of LCO material during the coating process , making it less than ideal for coating LCO. In this study, we chose piezoelectric material LiTaO3 (LTO) and ferroelectric materials SrTiO3 (STO) and MgTiO3 (MTO) first due to their lower synthesis temperatures. The fabrication of LTO, STO, and MTO as coating layers for LCO operates at 500, 700, and 700 \xb0C respectively, preventing the thermal decomposition of LCO during the coating process. First, LTO with synthesis temperature at about 500 \xb0C was used to demonstrate the easy possession as a coating layer of LCO electrode. The strong spontaneous polarization and excellent piezoelectric properties allow the coating layer to convert the stress generated during high-pressure charging and discharging of LCO into a polarizing electric field, thereby increasing the diffusion rate of LiE^{+} in the LCO material.

# CONCLUSION
In this work, the piezoelectric and ferroelectric materials were employed as a coating layer on the surface of the LCO electrode to enhance its electrochemical performance. Characterization tests were primarily conducted using LTO-LCO as an example. The polarization fields generated from the piezoelectric and ferroelectric coating layer provided a kinetic perspective to facilitate LiE^{+} transport, thereby reducing the diffusion barriers for LiE^{+} at the SEI membrane during the charge\u2013discharge processes. Simultaneously, the coating served as a physical barrier, reducing the side reactions between LCO and the electrolyte, thereby enhancing the stability of the battery. As a result, the optimal 2 wt% LTO-LCO electrode demonstrated a discharge-specific capacity of 172.8 mAh\xb7gE^{\u22121} and retained 84.8 % of its initial capacity when cycled 200 times at a rate of 0.1 C (135.8 mAh\xb7gE^{\u22121} at 5 C). This also validated the general applicability of piezoelectric and ferroelectric materials in the field of LIBs and provided new avenues for solutions.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The preparation procedure for LiTaO3-modified LiCoO2 (LTO-LCO) is illustrated in a, a simple sol\u2013gel method coupled with thermal treatment was utilized to coat LTO onto LCO uniformly. A modification mechanism was proposed based on the synergistic effect of physical isolation and piezoelectricity of the LTO coating layer on LCO. The lattice volume expansion of LCO accompanied the charging and discharging processes, then its stress was imparted onto LTO, leading to its piezoelectric polarization. To ascertain that the coating layer was indeed LTO, pure LTO powder was synthesized using the same preparation methodology employed in the fabrication of LTO-LCO. An XRD pattern with Rietveld refinement data (b) confirms that the synthesized material is pure LTO without other impurities. Characterization via Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), as illustrated in c, revealed that the LTO particles exhibited a uniform size distribution, with diameters averaging approximately 100 nm. The piezoelectric properties of pure LTO were also assessed, as summarized in a. LTO exhibits characteristic features of piezoelectric materials, with a piezoelectric coefficient (d 33) of 8 pC NE^{\u22121}, a dielectric constant (\u03b5 r) of 96.5, a capacitance (C) of 43 pF, and dielectric loss (tan\u03b4) of 0.06. b and 2c present the hysteresis loops of STO and MTO under diverse applied electric fields. For STO, the Pr value was approximately 0.26 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at 1 kV/mm, rose to about 0.67 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at 2 kV/mm, and reached around 1 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at 3 kV/mm. Similarly, for MTO, the Pr value began at roughly 0.006 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at 1 kV/mm, climbed to nearly 0.018 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at 2 kV/mm, and trended towards 0.031 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at 3 kV/mm. The XRD patterns of the synthetic sample powders with different coating contents were tested, as shown in a. No matter whether before and after coated LCO, the main diffraction peaks corresponding to (003), (101), and (104) planes indicate a hexagonal layered \u03b1-NaFeO2 structure with space group R-3 m (PDF#70\u20132685). The stable peak positions indicated that LTO modification did not alter the original crystal structure of LCO. Concurrently, as the LTO content increased, its diffraction peak became sharper, with a more pronounced differentiation of the (006)/(012) double peaks, indicating enhanced crystallinity and a more ordered layered structure. Rietveld refinement of the XRD shown in a and , and the refined data  confirm no apparent crystal change for LTO and LCO. S(2) of lattice mismatch, the lattice mismatch between LCO and LTO is as low as 2.13 %, indicating that the LTO coating layer and LCO material have excellent interface compatibility. SEM images (as depicted in b) reveal that the surface of the pristine LCO particle is smooth. In contrast, post-coating powders particles appeared on the surface of LCO grains, and the surface became coarser with the increased amount of coating layer. However, the particle size of LCO grains has no significant alteration, maintaining at approximately 5 \u03bcm, suggesting quite a thin LTO coating layer. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was employed to further investigate the thickness and uniformity of the coating layer across different content. As illustrated in c, the thickness of the coating layer shows a clear linear growth trend, increasing from 3.5 nm to 6.5 nm, and 10.5 nm with LTO coating amounts of 1 wt% to 3 wt%, respectively. In the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image of the 2 wt% LTO-LCO sample (d), the interface structure between the LCO matrix and the LTO coating was displayed. Lattice fringes corresponding to the (012) plane with an average spacing of 0.23 nm were identified, while heteroepitaxial lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.21 nm were attributed to the (202) plane of LTO. The HRTEM image revealed excellent interfacial bonding between the LTO coating and the LCO matrix, with no noticeable interfacial defects or gaps observed. This tight interfacial bonding facilitated the stabilization of the electrode\u2013electrolyte interface, thereby promoting efficient LiE^{+} migration. Furthermore, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis was performed on the 2 wt% LTO-LCO sample, as shown in e, to reveal the uniform distribution of Ta, Co elements on the LCO surface. The uniform presence of Ta indicates that the LTO coating layer was uniformly deposited on the surface of the LCO particles. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to investigate the surface elemental composition and valence state distribution of LTO-LCO samples. The spectra were standardized using the C 1 s peak at 284.8 eV, as depicted in and. The full spectra of LCO, 1 wt%, 2 wt%, and 3 wt% LTO-LCO show five main peaks at about 55, 284, 531, 684, and 780 eV, as shown in a and S1a, which correspond to the Li 1 s, C 1 s, O 1 s, F 1 s, and Co 2p spectra, respectively. The peaks at approximately 27.5 and 25.6 eV likely originate from the Ta 4f5/2 and Ta 4f7/2 spin\u2013orbit doublet of the TaE^{5+} oxidation state in the LTO coating (as illustrated in b), which emerges only after the coating process. In c and S2b-c, the XPS spectra display the Co 2p region for LCO samples before and after LTO coating. The binding energies of Co 2p1/2 and Co 2p3/2 were located around 795 eV and 780 eV, respectively, indicating that the LTO coating layer did not induce rehybridization of the Co 2p orbitals, thus maintaining a relatively stable chemical environment for cobalt. In addition, d displays the O 1 s spectra of LCO and 2 wt% LTO-LCO samples after 100 cycles. As depicted, the three peaks between 528 eV and 535 eV reflect the lattice oxygen peak, the oxygen vacancy peak, and the adsorbed oxygen peak, respectively. The lattice oxygen contents for LCO and 2 wt% LTO-LCO samples were determined to be 38.57 % and 49.64 %, respectively. This suggests that the LTO layer inhibits the oxidation of lattice oxygen at high voltages, thereby stabilizing the crystal structure of LCO and suppressing the formation of byproducts on the surface of LCO particles. The content of the adsorbed oxygen peak located around 532 eV shows an apparent decrease after LTO coating. This means that the LTO layer can be used as a protective barrier to prevent the adsorption of oxygen molecules and thus reduce the degree of surface oxidation for the LCO cathode material. From the C 1 s spectrum in e, the content percentage of Li2CO3 peak reduced by 3.87 % from 15.59 % of LCO to 11.72 % of 2 wt% LTO-LCO. The COC peak content percentage decreased by 7.07 % from LCO to 2 wt% LTO-LCO. This may be attributed to effectively isolating the electrolyte from physical contact with LCO by the LTO coating layer, thereby reducing the alkaline content on the surface of LCO particles. As depicted in f, the F 1 s spectrum was divided into three peaks, corresponding to C-F, LiF, and LixPOyFz/LixPFy, respectively. From the pristine LCO to 2 wt% LTO-LCO, the LixPOyFz/LixPFy peak disappeared, and the LiF peak content also decreased. This also means that the LTO coating layer reduces the physical contact between the electrolyte and LCO, thereby decreasing the decomposition of the LiPF6 component. Herein, LTO as a coating layer can effectively inhibit the occurrence of side reactions. To investigate the impact of piezoelectric LTO coating layer for the electrochemical performance of LCO, the charge\u2013discharge process of LCO samples before and after LTO coating were evaluated within a voltage range of 3.0 to 4.5 V. a depicts the cycling performance and coulomb efficiency curves of pristine LCO, 1 wt%, 2 wt%, and 3 wt% LTO-LCO samples at 0.1 C. The pristine LCO sample deteriorated at the 142nd cycle. The charge\u2013discharge cycles lead to repeated expansion and contraction of the crystal structure of LCO samples, which causes the accumulation of mechanical stress in LCO, resulting in capacity fade. As shown in , the surfaces of the original LCO grains were affected by cracks caused by stress resulting from long-term cycling. In contrast, the LCO grains coated with LTO exhibited a significant reduction in stress-induced expansion. In the TEM image of the 2 wt% LTO-LCO sample after long-term cycling , the interface structure between the LCO matrix and the LTO coating was displayed. Excellent interfacial bonding between the LTO coating and the LCO matrix was observed, with no noticeable interfacial defects or gaps. The results show that the LTO coating is not damaged by the stress during the long-term cycle and maintains good integrity. After 200 cycles, the 2 wt% LTO-LCO sample maintained a high discharge specific capacity of 172.8 mAh\xb7gE^{\u22121} and a good capacity retention rate of 84.8 %. In addition, as illustrated in b, the 2 wt% LTO-LCO sample testing at different rates also exhibited the highest discharge-specific capacities compared with the reference samples. For example, it maintained a capacity of 135.8 mAh\xb7gE^{\u22121} at a rate of 5 C and a capacity of 194.5 mAh\xb7gE^{\u22121} with the rate restored from 5 C to 0.1 C (97.3 % capacity retention rate). c displays the first charge\u2013discharge curves for all testing samples. It can be observed that the use of the LTO coating layer can improve the initial Coulombic efficiency of the LCO electrode. The 2 wt% LTO-LCO sample exhibited a high initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 76.73 %, significantly surpassing the pristine LCO (28.46 %). As can be observed from d and 5e, and e and S3f, voltage decay occurred as the number of cycles increased, related to the structural phase transitions and interfacial side reactions of LCO. During the charging process, an ordered-to-disordered transition occurred in the LCO samples when the voltage reached approximately 4.2 V, leading to fluctuations of the voltage drop in the charging curve. At a charging voltage of 4.5 V, a phase transition from the O3 phase to the H1-3 phase occurred, causing a capacity fade in the LCO samples. It can be observed that the pristine LCO sample exhibited fluctuations in the curve at positions of 4.10 and 4.18 V, while these fluctuations gradually disappeared for LTO coating samples. In addition, g-h and a-b present the first three cycles of CV curves for the four samples. It can be observed that the pristine LCO sample exhibited fluctuations in the curve at 4.18 V, whereas the LTO-coated samples did not show this phenomenon. The redox peaks remained unchanged, indicating that the LTO coating layer did not alter the structure of LCO, effectively extending the cycling life of LCO. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of LTO-LCO electrodes were conducted to further analyze the impact of the LTO coating layer on LiE^{+} diffusion kinetics. a-b and S3c-d present the CV curves at the 0th, 3rd, 50th, and 100th cycles for LTO-LCO electrode testing at a scan rate of 0.2 mV\xb7sE^{\u22121}. For pristine LCO electrodes, the intensity of the redox peaks decreased sharply, and the half-widths increased gradually with the increase of cycle numbers. However, for the 2 wt% LTO-LCO electrode, the intensity of the redox peaks strengthened, and the half-widths narrowed with the rise in cycle numbers. Furthermore, the CV curves were obtained with scan rates from 0.3 to 0.6 mV\xb7sE^{\u22121} within the 3.0\u20134.5 V voltage range, as illustrated in c-d, and g-h. For both of pristine LCO and 2 wt% LTO-LCO electrodes, their redox peak potentials shifted to both sides with the increased scan rates, indicating the polarization phenomenon of the battery. The linear relationship between the scan rate and the peak current in the CV curves was fitted by the Randles-Sevcik equation. As illustrated in e-f, the 2 wt% LTO-LCO electrode shows the highest slope among all the samples. Then the lithium-ion diffusion coefficients (DLi+) corresponding to the redox peaks of LTO-LCO electrodes were calculated using eq. S(3) , as depicted in g. The detailed DLi+ values are shown in and the 2 wt%LTO-LCO electrode exhibits the highest DLi+. Although the LTO coating layer does not provide battery electrode capacity, it enhances the LiE^{+} diffusion coefficient. h-i depict the Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) for LTO-LCO electrode testing at the first and the 200 cycles. The 2 wt% LTO-LCO samples exhibited the smallest solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) impedances (Rsf) for both the first and the 200 cycles, indicating the lowest impedance for LiE^{+} transport through the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). This suggests that the LTO coating layer reduced the direct contact between the LCO material and the electrolyte, thereby decreasing the occurrence of side reactions. Interestingly, the impedance values of 2 wt% LTO-LCO samples decreased gradually with cycle counts from the first to 200 cycles , which may be attributed to the fact that the piezoelectric properties of the LTO coating layer accelerated the diffusion rate of LiE^{+} at the electrolyte interface and formed a more stable and reliable electrolyte interface. The XPS spectra of the Bare LCO and 2 wt% LTO-LCO samples after 100 cycles are shown in. It was demonstrated that the LTO coating significantly suppressed the generation of side reactions at the electrode interface and the decomposition of the electrolyte. This effect facilitated easier LiE^{+} migration, thereby validating the role of LTO in regulating LiE^{+} behavior. In addition, low-temperature STO and MTO were studied as coatings for LCO electrodes. S(2) (see ), the lattice mismatch between MTO and LCO is small, while the lattice mismatch between STO and LCO is large. However, TEM analysis shows that STO and MTO cover the LCO interface, as shown in. The increase in electrochemical performance verifies the general applicability of ferroelectric coatings in converting the stresses generated during the LCO high-voltage charging-discharge cycle into polarized fields, thereby increasing the diffusion rate of LiE^{+}. shows the cycling and rate performance curves of STO-LCO and MTO-LCO electrodes with different contents as coating layers, tested in the voltage range of 3.0\u20134.5 V. The cycling and rate performance of the LCO electrodes were significantly improved after being coated with 1 wt% STO and MTO materials. This confirmed the general applicability of these materials in improving the performance of LCO. However, the performance of the LCO electrodes coated with LTO was even higher, indicating that while both STO and MTO coatings could improve the electrochemical performance of LCO, the LTO coating exhibited superior performance in terms of cycle stability and rate capability. The improved performance of the LTO-coated LCO can be attributed to its stronger spontaneous polarization and better piezoelectric properties, which more effectively converted the stress generated during high-pressure charging and discharging into a polarizing electric field. By studying the theoretical and experimental results in the existing literature , we propose a mechanism to explain how LTO coatings improve the electrochemical properties of the positive electrode of LCO. The modification mechanism of piezoelectric and ferroelectric coatings on LCO electrodes is illustrated in. During the charge\u2013discharge cycles, the insertion and extraction of LiE^{+} ions caused lattice expansion and a series of phase transitions in the LCO electrode, leading to stress\u2013strain accumulation. During the charging process, the extraction of lithium ions induced lattice expansion in the LCO electrode, generating stress that was subsequently transferred to the piezoelectric and ferroelectric coatings. These coatings then produced polarization fields opposite the direction of the stress and the LiE^{+} transport direction, preventing overcharging of the LCO electrode. In the discharging process, the stress on the coatings began to decrease, causing the polarization fields to align with the external electric field, which facilitated the insertion of LiE^{+} into the LCO electrode. At this stage, the polarization field acts as an accelerator for LiE^{+}, thereby enhancing the electrochemical performance of LCO. In summary, since the piezoelectric and ferroelectric coatings do not contribute to charge\u2013discharge capacity, the enhancement of the LCO electrode's electrochemical performance can be attributed to: 1) the reduction of physical contact between LCO and the electrolyte by the piezoelectric and ferroelectric coatings, thereby reducing the occurrence of interfacial side reactions; 2) the formation of a polarization field by the piezoelectric and ferroelectric coatings, which regulates the insertion and extraction of LiE^{+} during cycling, thus suppressing the ordered-to-disordered phase transition and mitigating the structural degradation of LCO.

Low-temperature piezoelectric/ferroelectric coating layer driving lithium-ion rapid diffusion and structure stability of LiCoO<inf>2</inf> cathode

# ABSTRACT
The increase in charging cut-off voltage accelerates the structure degradation and stress–strain accumulation of LiCoO2 (LCO) cathode, leading to heightened side reactions on the electrode surface and ultimately diminishing its electrochemical performance. Here, the piezoelectric LiTaO3 (LTO) and ferroelectric SrTiO3 (STO), and MgTiO3 (MTO) show matched preparation temperature with LCO electrode, which were utilized as coating layers to transform the stress and strain experienced during the high-voltage charging and discharging processes into polarization fields, thereby enhancing the electrochemical functionality. Taking the LTO coating layer as an example, the 2 wt% LTO-LCO electrode exhibits an obvious elevation of electrochemical, achieving 172.8 mAh·g−1 at 0.1 C (135.8 mAh·g−1 at 5 C) and maintaining a capacity retention rate of 84.8 % (1 C = 274 mAh·g−1, 3.0–4.5 V) after 200 cycles. This research proves that the low-temperature piezoelectric/ferroelectric materials can be used as a coating layer of LCO electrodes to transform the stress and strain into polarization fields, which reduce the lattice expansion and accelerate the Li+ transport for designing high-performance LCO batteries in the future.

# INTRODUCTION
With the rapid progression of renewable energy, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) with high energy densities have been extensively employed in power storage systems, electric vehicles, and portable electronic devices. As a pivotal cathode material for lithium batteries, LiCoO2 (LCO) garnered significant attention due to its high energy density, exceptional cyclic stability, and elevated voltage platform. The theoretical specific capacity of LCO cathode material is 274 mAh\xb7gE^{\u22121}, but its practical specific capacity, measured at 4.2 V, stands at approximately 140 mAh\xb7gE^{\u22121}, representing merely 50 % of its theoretical potential. In recent decades, the operational voltage of LCO increased from 4.2 V to 4.4 V, which corresponds with the practical capacity at this voltage typically amounting to roughly 60 % of the theoretical capacity. However, high voltage also means a high degree of delithiation, and the insertion and extraction of LiE^{+} during cycling can cause lattice expansion and a series of phase transitions, leading to significant stress\u2013strain accumulation in the crystal structure. Simultaneously, side reactions between the cathode material and the electrolyte increased, along with issues such as lattice oxygen loss, which led to a rapid decline in the cycling capacity of the LCO cathode material. With the introduction of metal oxide (Co3O4 , ZrO2 , TiO2 , etc.), metal fluoride (CaF2 , AlF3 , etc.), and fast ion conductor (Li2ZrO3 , LiVO3 , LiAlO2 , etc.) and other materials for covering, which not only reduces the side reactions between the particle surface of electrode material and the electrolyte using as physical isolation but also improves the efficiency of LiE^{+} diffusion. For example, Zhou et al. prepared Al2O3 nanoparticles as a coating layer of the LCO cathode and demonstrated a capacity retention rate of 82.6 % after 500 cycles at 1 C. Dai et al. prepared a CaF2-coated NCM811 sample by a simple wet chemical method. They showed a specific discharge capacity of 192.8 mAh\xb7gE^{\u22121} and coulomb efficiency of 86.42 %, which reduced the occurrence of side reactions, however, they did not improve the LiE^{+} diffusion efficiency. Song et al. prepared Li2ZrO3 coated LiNi0.7Co0.15Mn0.15O2 samples by sol\u2013gel method and precipitation method, and the capacity retention rate of the whole battery assembled by this method was 73.3 % after 1500 cycles at C/3 ratio. On the other hand, the stress generated by lithium-ion decoupling during the charge\u2013discharge cycle can also be converted into an internal polarization field. Recently, some LIB electrode materials have been modified using piezoelectric or ferroelectric as coating layers to transform the internal stress into polarization fields. For example, Ma et al. designed a diaphragm coating layer with BaTiO3, its piezoelectric property accelerates the redox kinetics of lithium-sulfur batteries and constructs the built-in electric field to improve the LiE^{+} transport, achieving a high-capacity retention rate after 400 cycles at 1 C. Lee et al. also proved that the composited silicon and BaTiO3 anodes can build a local electric field to improve the diffusion efficiency of LiE^{+}. However, the synthesis temperature of BaTiO3 typically exceeds 850 \xb0C, which can cause the thermal decomposition of LCO material during the coating process , making it less than ideal for coating LCO. In this study, we chose piezoelectric material LiTaO3 (LTO) and ferroelectric materials SrTiO3 (STO) and MgTiO3 (MTO) first due to their lower synthesis temperatures. The fabrication of LTO, STO, and MTO as coating layers for LCO operates at 500, 700, and 700 \xb0C respectively, preventing the thermal decomposition of LCO during the coating process. First, LTO with synthesis temperature at about 500 \xb0C was used to demonstrate the easy possession as a coating layer of LCO electrode. The strong spontaneous polarization and excellent piezoelectric properties allow the coating layer to convert the stress generated during high-pressure charging and discharging of LCO into a polarizing electric field, thereby increasing the diffusion rate of LiE^{+} in the LCO material.

# CONCLUSION
In this work, the piezoelectric and ferroelectric materials were employed as a coating layer on the surface of the LCO electrode to enhance its electrochemical performance. Characterization tests were primarily conducted using LTO-LCO as an example. The polarization fields generated from the piezoelectric and ferroelectric coating layer provided a kinetic perspective to facilitate LiE^{+} transport, thereby reducing the diffusion barriers for LiE^{+} at the SEI membrane during the charge\u2013discharge processes. Simultaneously, the coating served as a physical barrier, reducing the side reactions between LCO and the electrolyte, thereby enhancing the stability of the battery. As a result, the optimal 2 wt% LTO-LCO electrode demonstrated a discharge-specific capacity of 172.8 mAh\xb7gE^{\u22121} and retained 84.8 % of its initial capacity when cycled 200 times at a rate of 0.1 C (135.8 mAh\xb7gE^{\u22121} at 5 C). This also validated the general applicability of piezoelectric and ferroelectric materials in the field of LIBs and provided new avenues for solutions.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The preparation procedure for LiTaO3-modified LiCoO2 (LTO-LCO) is illustrated in a, a simple sol\u2013gel method coupled with thermal treatment was utilized to coat LTO onto LCO uniformly. A modification mechanism was proposed based on the synergistic effect of physical isolation and piezoelectricity of the LTO coating layer on LCO. The lattice volume expansion of LCO accompanied the charging and discharging processes, then its stress was imparted onto LTO, leading to its piezoelectric polarization. To ascertain that the coating layer was indeed LTO, pure LTO powder was synthesized using the same preparation methodology employed in the fabrication of LTO-LCO. An XRD pattern with Rietveld refinement data (b) confirms that the synthesized material is pure LTO without other impurities. Characterization via Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), as illustrated in c, revealed that the LTO particles exhibited a uniform size distribution, with diameters averaging approximately 100 nm. The piezoelectric properties of pure LTO were also assessed, as summarized in a. LTO exhibits characteristic features of piezoelectric materials, with a piezoelectric coefficient (d 33) of 8 pC NE^{\u22121}, a dielectric constant (\u03b5 r) of 96.5, a capacitance (C) of 43 pF, and dielectric loss (tan\u03b4) of 0.06. b and 2c present the hysteresis loops of STO and MTO under diverse applied electric fields. For STO, the Pr value was approximately 0.26 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at 1 kV/mm, rose to about 0.67 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at 2 kV/mm, and reached around 1 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at 3 kV/mm. Similarly, for MTO, the Pr value began at roughly 0.006 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at 1 kV/mm, climbed to nearly 0.018 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at 2 kV/mm, and trended towards 0.031 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at 3 kV/mm. The XRD patterns of the synthetic sample powders with different coating contents were tested, as shown in a. No matter whether before and after coated LCO, the main diffraction peaks corresponding to (003), (101), and (104) planes indicate a hexagonal layered \u03b1-NaFeO2 structure with space group R-3 m (PDF#70\u20132685). The stable peak positions indicated that LTO modification did not alter the original crystal structure of LCO. Concurrently, as the LTO content increased, its diffraction peak became sharper, with a more pronounced differentiation of the (006)/(012) double peaks, indicating enhanced crystallinity and a more ordered layered structure. Rietveld refinement of the XRD shown in a and , and the refined data  confirm no apparent crystal change for LTO and LCO. S(2) of lattice mismatch, the lattice mismatch between LCO and LTO is as low as 2.13 %, indicating that the LTO coating layer and LCO material have excellent interface compatibility. SEM images (as depicted in b) reveal that the surface of the pristine LCO particle is smooth. In contrast, post-coating powders particles appeared on the surface of LCO grains, and the surface became coarser with the increased amount of coating layer. However, the particle size of LCO grains has no significant alteration, maintaining at approximately 5 \u03bcm, suggesting quite a thin LTO coating layer. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was employed to further investigate the thickness and uniformity of the coating layer across different content. As illustrated in c, the thickness of the coating layer shows a clear linear growth trend, increasing from 3.5 nm to 6.5 nm, and 10.5 nm with LTO coating amounts of 1 wt% to 3 wt%, respectively. In the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image of the 2 wt% LTO-LCO sample (d), the interface structure between the LCO matrix and the LTO coating was displayed. Lattice fringes corresponding to the (012) plane with an average spacing of 0.23 nm were identified, while heteroepitaxial lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.21 nm were attributed to the (202) plane of LTO. The HRTEM image revealed excellent interfacial bonding between the LTO coating and the LCO matrix, with no noticeable interfacial defects or gaps observed. This tight interfacial bonding facilitated the stabilization of the electrode\u2013electrolyte interface, thereby promoting efficient LiE^{+} migration. Furthermore, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis was performed on the 2 wt% LTO-LCO sample, as shown in e, to reveal the uniform distribution of Ta, Co elements on the LCO surface. The uniform presence of Ta indicates that the LTO coating layer was uniformly deposited on the surface of the LCO particles. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to investigate the surface elemental composition and valence state distribution of LTO-LCO samples. The spectra were standardized using the C 1 s peak at 284.8 eV, as depicted in and. The full spectra of LCO, 1 wt%, 2 wt%, and 3 wt% LTO-LCO show five main peaks at about 55, 284, 531, 684, and 780 eV, as shown in a and S1a, which correspond to the Li 1 s, C 1 s, O 1 s, F 1 s, and Co 2p spectra, respectively. The peaks at approximately 27.5 and 25.6 eV likely originate from the Ta 4f5/2 and Ta 4f7/2 spin\u2013orbit doublet of the TaE^{5+} oxidation state in the LTO coating (as illustrated in b), which emerges only after the coating process. In c and S2b-c, the XPS spectra display the Co 2p region for LCO samples before and after LTO coating. The binding energies of Co 2p1/2 and Co 2p3/2 were located around 795 eV and 780 eV, respectively, indicating that the LTO coating layer did not induce rehybridization of the Co 2p orbitals, thus maintaining a relatively stable chemical environment for cobalt. In addition, d displays the O 1 s spectra of LCO and 2 wt% LTO-LCO samples after 100 cycles. As depicted, the three peaks between 528 eV and 535 eV reflect the lattice oxygen peak, the oxygen vacancy peak, and the adsorbed oxygen peak, respectively. The lattice oxygen contents for LCO and 2 wt% LTO-LCO samples were determined to be 38.57 % and 49.64 %, respectively. This suggests that the LTO layer inhibits the oxidation of lattice oxygen at high voltages, thereby stabilizing the crystal structure of LCO and suppressing the formation of byproducts on the surface of LCO particles. The content of the adsorbed oxygen peak located around 532 eV shows an apparent decrease after LTO coating. This means that the LTO layer can be used as a protective barrier to prevent the adsorption of oxygen molecules and thus reduce the degree of surface oxidation for the LCO cathode material. From the C 1 s spectrum in e, the content percentage of Li2CO3 peak reduced by 3.87 % from 15.59 % of LCO to 11.72 % of 2 wt% LTO-LCO. The COC peak content percentage decreased by 7.07 % from LCO to 2 wt% LTO-LCO. This may be attributed to effectively isolating the electrolyte from physical contact with LCO by the LTO coating layer, thereby reducing the alkaline content on the surface of LCO particles. As depicted in f, the F 1 s spectrum was divided into three peaks, corresponding to C-F, LiF, and LixPOyFz/LixPFy, respectively. From the pristine LCO to 2 wt% LTO-LCO, the LixPOyFz/LixPFy peak disappeared, and the LiF peak content also decreased. This also means that the LTO coating layer reduces the physical contact between the electrolyte and LCO, thereby decreasing the decomposition of the LiPF6 component. Herein, LTO as a coating layer can effectively inhibit the occurrence of side reactions. To investigate the impact of piezoelectric LTO coating layer for the electrochemical performance of LCO, the charge\u2013discharge process of LCO samples before and after LTO coating were evaluated within a voltage range of 3.0 to 4.5 V. a depicts the cycling performance and coulomb efficiency curves of pristine LCO, 1 wt%, 2 wt%, and 3 wt% LTO-LCO samples at 0.1 C. The pristine LCO sample deteriorated at the 142nd cycle. The charge\u2013discharge cycles lead to repeated expansion and contraction of the crystal structure of LCO samples, which causes the accumulation of mechanical stress in LCO, resulting in capacity fade. As shown in , the surfaces of the original LCO grains were affected by cracks caused by stress resulting from long-term cycling. In contrast, the LCO grains coated with LTO exhibited a significant reduction in stress-induced expansion. In the TEM image of the 2 wt% LTO-LCO sample after long-term cycling , the interface structure between the LCO matrix and the LTO coating was displayed. Excellent interfacial bonding between the LTO coating and the LCO matrix was observed, with no noticeable interfacial defects or gaps. The results show that the LTO coating is not damaged by the stress during the long-term cycle and maintains good integrity. After 200 cycles, the 2 wt% LTO-LCO sample maintained a high discharge specific capacity of 172.8 mAh\xb7gE^{\u22121} and a good capacity retention rate of 84.8 %. In addition, as illustrated in b, the 2 wt% LTO-LCO sample testing at different rates also exhibited the highest discharge-specific capacities compared with the reference samples. For example, it maintained a capacity of 135.8 mAh\xb7gE^{\u22121} at a rate of 5 C and a capacity of 194.5 mAh\xb7gE^{\u22121} with the rate restored from 5 C to 0.1 C (97.3 % capacity retention rate). c displays the first charge\u2013discharge curves for all testing samples. It can be observed that the use of the LTO coating layer can improve the initial Coulombic efficiency of the LCO electrode. The 2 wt% LTO-LCO sample exhibited a high initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 76.73 %, significantly surpassing the pristine LCO (28.46 %). As can be observed from d and 5e, and e and S3f, voltage decay occurred as the number of cycles increased, related to the structural phase transitions and interfacial side reactions of LCO. During the charging process, an ordered-to-disordered transition occurred in the LCO samples when the voltage reached approximately 4.2 V, leading to fluctuations of the voltage drop in the charging curve. At a charging voltage of 4.5 V, a phase transition from the O3 phase to the H1-3 phase occurred, causing a capacity fade in the LCO samples. It can be observed that the pristine LCO sample exhibited fluctuations in the curve at positions of 4.10 and 4.18 V, while these fluctuations gradually disappeared for LTO coating samples. In addition, g-h and a-b present the first three cycles of CV curves for the four samples. It can be observed that the pristine LCO sample exhibited fluctuations in the curve at 4.18 V, whereas the LTO-coated samples did not show this phenomenon. The redox peaks remained unchanged, indicating that the LTO coating layer did not alter the structure of LCO, effectively extending the cycling life of LCO. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of LTO-LCO electrodes were conducted to further analyze the impact of the LTO coating layer on LiE^{+} diffusion kinetics. a-b and S3c-d present the CV curves at the 0th, 3rd, 50th, and 100th cycles for LTO-LCO electrode testing at a scan rate of 0.2 mV\xb7sE^{\u22121}. For pristine LCO electrodes, the intensity of the redox peaks decreased sharply, and the half-widths increased gradually with the increase of cycle numbers. However, for the 2 wt% LTO-LCO electrode, the intensity of the redox peaks strengthened, and the half-widths narrowed with the rise in cycle numbers. Furthermore, the CV curves were obtained with scan rates from 0.3 to 0.6 mV\xb7sE^{\u22121} within the 3.0\u20134.5 V voltage range, as illustrated in c-d, and g-h. For both of pristine LCO and 2 wt% LTO-LCO electrodes, their redox peak potentials shifted to both sides with the increased scan rates, indicating the polarization phenomenon of the battery. The linear relationship between the scan rate and the peak current in the CV curves was fitted by the Randles-Sevcik equation. As illustrated in e-f, the 2 wt% LTO-LCO electrode shows the highest slope among all the samples. Then the lithium-ion diffusion coefficients (DLi+) corresponding to the redox peaks of LTO-LCO electrodes were calculated using eq. S(3) , as depicted in g. The detailed DLi+ values are shown in and the 2 wt%LTO-LCO electrode exhibits the highest DLi+. Although the LTO coating layer does not provide battery electrode capacity, it enhances the LiE^{+} diffusion coefficient. h-i depict the Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) for LTO-LCO electrode testing at the first and the 200 cycles. The 2 wt% LTO-LCO samples exhibited the smallest solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) impedances (Rsf) for both the first and the 200 cycles, indicating the lowest impedance for LiE^{+} transport through the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). This suggests that the LTO coating layer reduced the direct contact between the LCO material and the electrolyte, thereby decreasing the occurrence of side reactions. Interestingly, the impedance values of 2 wt% LTO-LCO samples decreased gradually with cycle counts from the first to 200 cycles , which may be attributed to the fact that the piezoelectric properties of the LTO coating layer accelerated the diffusion rate of LiE^{+} at the electrolyte interface and formed a more stable and reliable electrolyte interface. The XPS spectra of the Bare LCO and 2 wt% LTO-LCO samples after 100 cycles are shown in. It was demonstrated that the LTO coating significantly suppressed the generation of side reactions at the electrode interface and the decomposition of the electrolyte. This effect facilitated easier LiE^{+} migration, thereby validating the role of LTO in regulating LiE^{+} behavior. In addition, low-temperature STO and MTO were studied as coatings for LCO electrodes. S(2) (see ), the lattice mismatch between MTO and LCO is small, while the lattice mismatch between STO and LCO is large. However, TEM analysis shows that STO and MTO cover the LCO interface, as shown in. The increase in electrochemical performance verifies the general applicability of ferroelectric coatings in converting the stresses generated during the LCO high-voltage charging-discharge cycle into polarized fields, thereby increasing the diffusion rate of LiE^{+}. shows the cycling and rate performance curves of STO-LCO and MTO-LCO electrodes with different contents as coating layers, tested in the voltage range of 3.0\u20134.5 V. The cycling and rate performance of the LCO electrodes were significantly improved after being coated with 1 wt% STO and MTO materials. This confirmed the general applicability of these materials in improving the performance of LCO. However, the performance of the LCO electrodes coated with LTO was even higher, indicating that while both STO and MTO coatings could improve the electrochemical performance of LCO, the LTO coating exhibited superior performance in terms of cycle stability and rate capability. The improved performance of the LTO-coated LCO can be attributed to its stronger spontaneous polarization and better piezoelectric properties, which more effectively converted the stress generated during high-pressure charging and discharging into a polarizing electric field. By studying the theoretical and experimental results in the existing literature , we propose a mechanism to explain how LTO coatings improve the electrochemical properties of the positive electrode of LCO. The modification mechanism of piezoelectric and ferroelectric coatings on LCO electrodes is illustrated in. During the charge\u2013discharge cycles, the insertion and extraction of LiE^{+} ions caused lattice expansion and a series of phase transitions in the LCO electrode, leading to stress\u2013strain accumulation. During the charging process, the extraction of lithium ions induced lattice expansion in the LCO electrode, generating stress that was subsequently transferred to the piezoelectric and ferroelectric coatings. These coatings then produced polarization fields opposite the direction of the stress and the LiE^{+} transport direction, preventing overcharging of the LCO electrode. In the discharging process, the stress on the coatings began to decrease, causing the polarization fields to align with the external electric field, which facilitated the insertion of LiE^{+} into the LCO electrode. At this stage, the polarization field acts as an accelerator for LiE^{+}, thereby enhancing the electrochemical performance of LCO. In summary, since the piezoelectric and ferroelectric coatings do not contribute to charge\u2013discharge capacity, the enhancement of the LCO electrode's electrochemical performance can be attributed to: 1) the reduction of physical contact between LCO and the electrolyte by the piezoelectric and ferroelectric coatings, thereby reducing the occurrence of interfacial side reactions; 2) the formation of a polarization field by the piezoelectric and ferroelectric coatings, which regulates the insertion and extraction of LiE^{+} during cycling, thus suppressing the ordered-to-disordered phase transition and mitigating the structural degradation of LCO.

Low-temperature piezoelectric/ferroelectric coating layer driving lithium-ion rapid diffusion and structure stability of LiCoO<inf>2</inf> cathode

# ABSTRACT
The increase in charging cut-off voltage accelerates the structure degradation and stress–strain accumulation of LiCoO2 (LCO) cathode, leading to heightened side reactions on the electrode surface and ultimately diminishing its electrochemical performance. Here, the piezoelectric LiTaO3 (LTO) and ferroelectric SrTiO3 (STO), and MgTiO3 (MTO) show matched preparation temperature with LCO electrode, which were utilized as coating layers to transform the stress and strain experienced during the high-voltage charging and discharging processes into polarization fields, thereby enhancing the electrochemical functionality. Taking the LTO coating layer as an example, the 2 wt% LTO-LCO electrode exhibits an obvious elevation of electrochemical, achieving 172.8 mAh·g−1 at 0.1 C (135.8 mAh·g−1 at 5 C) and maintaining a capacity retention rate of 84.8 % (1 C = 274 mAh·g−1, 3.0–4.5 V) after 200 cycles. This research proves that the low-temperature piezoelectric/ferroelectric materials can be used as a coating layer of LCO electrodes to transform the stress and strain into polarization fields, which reduce the lattice expansion and accelerate the Li+ transport for designing high-performance LCO batteries in the future.

# INTRODUCTION
With the rapid progression of renewable energy, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) with high energy densities have been extensively employed in power storage systems, electric vehicles, and portable electronic devices. As a pivotal cathode material for lithium batteries, LiCoO2 (LCO) garnered significant attention due to its high energy density, exceptional cyclic stability, and elevated voltage platform. The theoretical specific capacity of LCO cathode material is 274 mAh\xb7gE^{\u22121}, but its practical specific capacity, measured at 4.2 V, stands at approximately 140 mAh\xb7gE^{\u22121}, representing merely 50 % of its theoretical potential. In recent decades, the operational voltage of LCO increased from 4.2 V to 4.4 V, which corresponds with the practical capacity at this voltage typically amounting to roughly 60 % of the theoretical capacity. However, high voltage also means a high degree of delithiation, and the insertion and extraction of LiE^{+} during cycling can cause lattice expansion and a series of phase transitions, leading to significant stress\u2013strain accumulation in the crystal structure. Simultaneously, side reactions between the cathode material and the electrolyte increased, along with issues such as lattice oxygen loss, which led to a rapid decline in the cycling capacity of the LCO cathode material. With the introduction of metal oxide (Co3O4 , ZrO2 , TiO2 , etc.), metal fluoride (CaF2 , AlF3 , etc.), and fast ion conductor (Li2ZrO3 , LiVO3 , LiAlO2 , etc.) and other materials for covering, which not only reduces the side reactions between the particle surface of electrode material and the electrolyte using as physical isolation but also improves the efficiency of LiE^{+} diffusion. For example, Zhou et al. prepared Al2O3 nanoparticles as a coating layer of the LCO cathode and demonstrated a capacity retention rate of 82.6 % after 500 cycles at 1 C. Dai et al. prepared a CaF2-coated NCM811 sample by a simple wet chemical method. They showed a specific discharge capacity of 192.8 mAh\xb7gE^{\u22121} and coulomb efficiency of 86.42 %, which reduced the occurrence of side reactions, however, they did not improve the LiE^{+} diffusion efficiency. Song et al. prepared Li2ZrO3 coated LiNi0.7Co0.15Mn0.15O2 samples by sol\u2013gel method and precipitation method, and the capacity retention rate of the whole battery assembled by this method was 73.3 % after 1500 cycles at C/3 ratio. On the other hand, the stress generated by lithium-ion decoupling during the charge\u2013discharge cycle can also be converted into an internal polarization field. Recently, some LIB electrode materials have been modified using piezoelectric or ferroelectric as coating layers to transform the internal stress into polarization fields. For example, Ma et al. designed a diaphragm coating layer with BaTiO3, its piezoelectric property accelerates the redox kinetics of lithium-sulfur batteries and constructs the built-in electric field to improve the LiE^{+} transport, achieving a high-capacity retention rate after 400 cycles at 1 C. Lee et al. also proved that the composited silicon and BaTiO3 anodes can build a local electric field to improve the diffusion efficiency of LiE^{+}. However, the synthesis temperature of BaTiO3 typically exceeds 850 \xb0C, which can cause the thermal decomposition of LCO material during the coating process , making it less than ideal for coating LCO. In this study, we chose piezoelectric material LiTaO3 (LTO) and ferroelectric materials SrTiO3 (STO) and MgTiO3 (MTO) first due to their lower synthesis temperatures. The fabrication of LTO, STO, and MTO as coating layers for LCO operates at 500, 700, and 700 \xb0C respectively, preventing the thermal decomposition of LCO during the coating process. First, LTO with synthesis temperature at about 500 \xb0C was used to demonstrate the easy possession as a coating layer of LCO electrode. The strong spontaneous polarization and excellent piezoelectric properties allow the coating layer to convert the stress generated during high-pressure charging and discharging of LCO into a polarizing electric field, thereby increasing the diffusion rate of LiE^{+} in the LCO material.

# CONCLUSION
In this work, the piezoelectric and ferroelectric materials were employed as a coating layer on the surface of the LCO electrode to enhance its electrochemical performance. Characterization tests were primarily conducted using LTO-LCO as an example. The polarization fields generated from the piezoelectric and ferroelectric coating layer provided a kinetic perspective to facilitate LiE^{+} transport, thereby reducing the diffusion barriers for LiE^{+} at the SEI membrane during the charge\u2013discharge processes. Simultaneously, the coating served as a physical barrier, reducing the side reactions between LCO and the electrolyte, thereby enhancing the stability of the battery. As a result, the optimal 2 wt% LTO-LCO electrode demonstrated a discharge-specific capacity of 172.8 mAh\xb7gE^{\u22121} and retained 84.8 % of its initial capacity when cycled 200 times at a rate of 0.1 C (135.8 mAh\xb7gE^{\u22121} at 5 C). This also validated the general applicability of piezoelectric and ferroelectric materials in the field of LIBs and provided new avenues for solutions.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The preparation procedure for LiTaO3-modified LiCoO2 (LTO-LCO) is illustrated in a, a simple sol\u2013gel method coupled with thermal treatment was utilized to coat LTO onto LCO uniformly. A modification mechanism was proposed based on the synergistic effect of physical isolation and piezoelectricity of the LTO coating layer on LCO. The lattice volume expansion of LCO accompanied the charging and discharging processes, then its stress was imparted onto LTO, leading to its piezoelectric polarization. To ascertain that the coating layer was indeed LTO, pure LTO powder was synthesized using the same preparation methodology employed in the fabrication of LTO-LCO. An XRD pattern with Rietveld refinement data (b) confirms that the synthesized material is pure LTO without other impurities. Characterization via Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), as illustrated in c, revealed that the LTO particles exhibited a uniform size distribution, with diameters averaging approximately 100 nm. The piezoelectric properties of pure LTO were also assessed, as summarized in a. LTO exhibits characteristic features of piezoelectric materials, with a piezoelectric coefficient (d 33) of 8 pC NE^{\u22121}, a dielectric constant (\u03b5 r) of 96.5, a capacitance (C) of 43 pF, and dielectric loss (tan\u03b4) of 0.06. b and 2c present the hysteresis loops of STO and MTO under diverse applied electric fields. For STO, the Pr value was approximately 0.26 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at 1 kV/mm, rose to about 0.67 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at 2 kV/mm, and reached around 1 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at 3 kV/mm. Similarly, for MTO, the Pr value began at roughly 0.006 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at 1 kV/mm, climbed to nearly 0.018 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at 2 kV/mm, and trended towards 0.031 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} at 3 kV/mm. The XRD patterns of the synthetic sample powders with different coating contents were tested, as shown in a. No matter whether before and after coated LCO, the main diffraction peaks corresponding to (003), (101), and (104) planes indicate a hexagonal layered \u03b1-NaFeO2 structure with space group R-3 m (PDF#70\u20132685). The stable peak positions indicated that LTO modification did not alter the original crystal structure of LCO. Concurrently, as the LTO content increased, its diffraction peak became sharper, with a more pronounced differentiation of the (006)/(012) double peaks, indicating enhanced crystallinity and a more ordered layered structure. Rietveld refinement of the XRD shown in a and , and the refined data  confirm no apparent crystal change for LTO and LCO. S(2) of lattice mismatch, the lattice mismatch between LCO and LTO is as low as 2.13 %, indicating that the LTO coating layer and LCO material have excellent interface compatibility. SEM images (as depicted in b) reveal that the surface of the pristine LCO particle is smooth. In contrast, post-coating powders particles appeared on the surface of LCO grains, and the surface became coarser with the increased amount of coating layer. However, the particle size of LCO grains has no significant alteration, maintaining at approximately 5 \u03bcm, suggesting quite a thin LTO coating layer. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was employed to further investigate the thickness and uniformity of the coating layer across different content. As illustrated in c, the thickness of the coating layer shows a clear linear growth trend, increasing from 3.5 nm to 6.5 nm, and 10.5 nm with LTO coating amounts of 1 wt% to 3 wt%, respectively. In the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image of the 2 wt% LTO-LCO sample (d), the interface structure between the LCO matrix and the LTO coating was displayed. Lattice fringes corresponding to the (012) plane with an average spacing of 0.23 nm were identified, while heteroepitaxial lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.21 nm were attributed to the (202) plane of LTO. The HRTEM image revealed excellent interfacial bonding between the LTO coating and the LCO matrix, with no noticeable interfacial defects or gaps observed. This tight interfacial bonding facilitated the stabilization of the electrode\u2013electrolyte interface, thereby promoting efficient LiE^{+} migration. Furthermore, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis was performed on the 2 wt% LTO-LCO sample, as shown in e, to reveal the uniform distribution of Ta, Co elements on the LCO surface. The uniform presence of Ta indicates that the LTO coating layer was uniformly deposited on the surface of the LCO particles. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to investigate the surface elemental composition and valence state distribution of LTO-LCO samples. The spectra were standardized using the C 1 s peak at 284.8 eV, as depicted in and. The full spectra of LCO, 1 wt%, 2 wt%, and 3 wt% LTO-LCO show five main peaks at about 55, 284, 531, 684, and 780 eV, as shown in a and S1a, which correspond to the Li 1 s, C 1 s, O 1 s, F 1 s, and Co 2p spectra, respectively. The peaks at approximately 27.5 and 25.6 eV likely originate from the Ta 4f5/2 and Ta 4f7/2 spin\u2013orbit doublet of the TaE^{5+} oxidation state in the LTO coating (as illustrated in b), which emerges only after the coating process. In c and S2b-c, the XPS spectra display the Co 2p region for LCO samples before and after LTO coating. The binding energies of Co 2p1/2 and Co 2p3/2 were located around 795 eV and 780 eV, respectively, indicating that the LTO coating layer did not induce rehybridization of the Co 2p orbitals, thus maintaining a relatively stable chemical environment for cobalt. In addition, d displays the O 1 s spectra of LCO and 2 wt% LTO-LCO samples after 100 cycles. As depicted, the three peaks between 528 eV and 535 eV reflect the lattice oxygen peak, the oxygen vacancy peak, and the adsorbed oxygen peak, respectively. The lattice oxygen contents for LCO and 2 wt% LTO-LCO samples were determined to be 38.57 % and 49.64 %, respectively. This suggests that the LTO layer inhibits the oxidation of lattice oxygen at high voltages, thereby stabilizing the crystal structure of LCO and suppressing the formation of byproducts on the surface of LCO particles. The content of the adsorbed oxygen peak located around 532 eV shows an apparent decrease after LTO coating. This means that the LTO layer can be used as a protective barrier to prevent the adsorption of oxygen molecules and thus reduce the degree of surface oxidation for the LCO cathode material. From the C 1 s spectrum in e, the content percentage of Li2CO3 peak reduced by 3.87 % from 15.59 % of LCO to 11.72 % of 2 wt% LTO-LCO. The COC peak content percentage decreased by 7.07 % from LCO to 2 wt% LTO-LCO. This may be attributed to effectively isolating the electrolyte from physical contact with LCO by the LTO coating layer, thereby reducing the alkaline content on the surface of LCO particles. As depicted in f, the F 1 s spectrum was divided into three peaks, corresponding to C-F, LiF, and LixPOyFz/LixPFy, respectively. From the pristine LCO to 2 wt% LTO-LCO, the LixPOyFz/LixPFy peak disappeared, and the LiF peak content also decreased. This also means that the LTO coating layer reduces the physical contact between the electrolyte and LCO, thereby decreasing the decomposition of the LiPF6 component. Herein, LTO as a coating layer can effectively inhibit the occurrence of side reactions. To investigate the impact of piezoelectric LTO coating layer for the electrochemical performance of LCO, the charge\u2013discharge process of LCO samples before and after LTO coating were evaluated within a voltage range of 3.0 to 4.5 V. a depicts the cycling performance and coulomb efficiency curves of pristine LCO, 1 wt%, 2 wt%, and 3 wt% LTO-LCO samples at 0.1 C. The pristine LCO sample deteriorated at the 142nd cycle. The charge\u2013discharge cycles lead to repeated expansion and contraction of the crystal structure of LCO samples, which causes the accumulation of mechanical stress in LCO, resulting in capacity fade. As shown in , the surfaces of the original LCO grains were affected by cracks caused by stress resulting from long-term cycling. In contrast, the LCO grains coated with LTO exhibited a significant reduction in stress-induced expansion. In the TEM image of the 2 wt% LTO-LCO sample after long-term cycling , the interface structure between the LCO matrix and the LTO coating was displayed. Excellent interfacial bonding between the LTO coating and the LCO matrix was observed, with no noticeable interfacial defects or gaps. The results show that the LTO coating is not damaged by the stress during the long-term cycle and maintains good integrity. After 200 cycles, the 2 wt% LTO-LCO sample maintained a high discharge specific capacity of 172.8 mAh\xb7gE^{\u22121} and a good capacity retention rate of 84.8 %. In addition, as illustrated in b, the 2 wt% LTO-LCO sample testing at different rates also exhibited the highest discharge-specific capacities compared with the reference samples. For example, it maintained a capacity of 135.8 mAh\xb7gE^{\u22121} at a rate of 5 C and a capacity of 194.5 mAh\xb7gE^{\u22121} with the rate restored from 5 C to 0.1 C (97.3 % capacity retention rate). c displays the first charge\u2013discharge curves for all testing samples. It can be observed that the use of the LTO coating layer can improve the initial Coulombic efficiency of the LCO electrode. The 2 wt% LTO-LCO sample exhibited a high initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 76.73 %, significantly surpassing the pristine LCO (28.46 %). As can be observed from d and 5e, and e and S3f, voltage decay occurred as the number of cycles increased, related to the structural phase transitions and interfacial side reactions of LCO. During the charging process, an ordered-to-disordered transition occurred in the LCO samples when the voltage reached approximately 4.2 V, leading to fluctuations of the voltage drop in the charging curve. At a charging voltage of 4.5 V, a phase transition from the O3 phase to the H1-3 phase occurred, causing a capacity fade in the LCO samples. It can be observed that the pristine LCO sample exhibited fluctuations in the curve at positions of 4.10 and 4.18 V, while these fluctuations gradually disappeared for LTO coating samples. In addition, g-h and a-b present the first three cycles of CV curves for the four samples. It can be observed that the pristine LCO sample exhibited fluctuations in the curve at 4.18 V, whereas the LTO-coated samples did not show this phenomenon. The redox peaks remained unchanged, indicating that the LTO coating layer did not alter the structure of LCO, effectively extending the cycling life of LCO. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of LTO-LCO electrodes were conducted to further analyze the impact of the LTO coating layer on LiE^{+} diffusion kinetics. a-b and S3c-d present the CV curves at the 0th, 3rd, 50th, and 100th cycles for LTO-LCO electrode testing at a scan rate of 0.2 mV\xb7sE^{\u22121}. For pristine LCO electrodes, the intensity of the redox peaks decreased sharply, and the half-widths increased gradually with the increase of cycle numbers. However, for the 2 wt% LTO-LCO electrode, the intensity of the redox peaks strengthened, and the half-widths narrowed with the rise in cycle numbers. Furthermore, the CV curves were obtained with scan rates from 0.3 to 0.6 mV\xb7sE^{\u22121} within the 3.0\u20134.5 V voltage range, as illustrated in c-d, and g-h. For both of pristine LCO and 2 wt% LTO-LCO electrodes, their redox peak potentials shifted to both sides with the increased scan rates, indicating the polarization phenomenon of the battery. The linear relationship between the scan rate and the peak current in the CV curves was fitted by the Randles-Sevcik equation. As illustrated in e-f, the 2 wt% LTO-LCO electrode shows the highest slope among all the samples. Then the lithium-ion diffusion coefficients (DLi+) corresponding to the redox peaks of LTO-LCO electrodes were calculated using eq. S(3) , as depicted in g. The detailed DLi+ values are shown in and the 2 wt%LTO-LCO electrode exhibits the highest DLi+. Although the LTO coating layer does not provide battery electrode capacity, it enhances the LiE^{+} diffusion coefficient. h-i depict the Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) for LTO-LCO electrode testing at the first and the 200 cycles. The 2 wt% LTO-LCO samples exhibited the smallest solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) impedances (Rsf) for both the first and the 200 cycles, indicating the lowest impedance for LiE^{+} transport through the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). This suggests that the LTO coating layer reduced the direct contact between the LCO material and the electrolyte, thereby decreasing the occurrence of side reactions. Interestingly, the impedance values of 2 wt% LTO-LCO samples decreased gradually with cycle counts from the first to 200 cycles , which may be attributed to the fact that the piezoelectric properties of the LTO coating layer accelerated the diffusion rate of LiE^{+} at the electrolyte interface and formed a more stable and reliable electrolyte interface. The XPS spectra of the Bare LCO and 2 wt% LTO-LCO samples after 100 cycles are shown in. It was demonstrated that the LTO coating significantly suppressed the generation of side reactions at the electrode interface and the decomposition of the electrolyte. This effect facilitated easier LiE^{+} migration, thereby validating the role of LTO in regulating LiE^{+} behavior. In addition, low-temperature STO and MTO were studied as coatings for LCO electrodes. S(2) (see ), the lattice mismatch between MTO and LCO is small, while the lattice mismatch between STO and LCO is large. However, TEM analysis shows that STO and MTO cover the LCO interface, as shown in. The increase in electrochemical performance verifies the general applicability of ferroelectric coatings in converting the stresses generated during the LCO high-voltage charging-discharge cycle into polarized fields, thereby increasing the diffusion rate of LiE^{+}. shows the cycling and rate performance curves of STO-LCO and MTO-LCO electrodes with different contents as coating layers, tested in the voltage range of 3.0\u20134.5 V. The cycling and rate performance of the LCO electrodes were significantly improved after being coated with 1 wt% STO and MTO materials. This confirmed the general applicability of these materials in improving the performance of LCO. However, the performance of the LCO electrodes coated with LTO was even higher, indicating that while both STO and MTO coatings could improve the electrochemical performance of LCO, the LTO coating exhibited superior performance in terms of cycle stability and rate capability. The improved performance of the LTO-coated LCO can be attributed to its stronger spontaneous polarization and better piezoelectric properties, which more effectively converted the stress generated during high-pressure charging and discharging into a polarizing electric field. By studying the theoretical and experimental results in the existing literature , we propose a mechanism to explain how LTO coatings improve the electrochemical properties of the positive electrode of LCO. The modification mechanism of piezoelectric and ferroelectric coatings on LCO electrodes is illustrated in. During the charge\u2013discharge cycles, the insertion and extraction of LiE^{+} ions caused lattice expansion and a series of phase transitions in the LCO electrode, leading to stress\u2013strain accumulation. During the charging process, the extraction of lithium ions induced lattice expansion in the LCO electrode, generating stress that was subsequently transferred to the piezoelectric and ferroelectric coatings. These coatings then produced polarization fields opposite the direction of the stress and the LiE^{+} transport direction, preventing overcharging of the LCO electrode. In the discharging process, the stress on the coatings began to decrease, causing the polarization fields to align with the external electric field, which facilitated the insertion of LiE^{+} into the LCO electrode. At this stage, the polarization field acts as an accelerator for LiE^{+}, thereby enhancing the electrochemical performance of LCO. In summary, since the piezoelectric and ferroelectric coatings do not contribute to charge\u2013discharge capacity, the enhancement of the LCO electrode's electrochemical performance can be attributed to: 1) the reduction of physical contact between LCO and the electrolyte by the piezoelectric and ferroelectric coatings, thereby reducing the occurrence of interfacial side reactions; 2) the formation of a polarization field by the piezoelectric and ferroelectric coatings, which regulates the insertion and extraction of LiE^{+} during cycling, thus suppressing the ordered-to-disordered phase transition and mitigating the structural degradation of LCO.

# ABSTRACT
The increase in charging cut-off voltage accelerates the structure degradation and stress–strain accumulation of LiCoO2 (LCO) cathode, leading to heightened side reactions on the electrode surface and ultimately diminishing its electrochemical performance. Here, the piezoelectric LiTaO3 (LTO) and ferroelectric SrTiO3 (STO), and MgTiO3 (MTO) show matched preparation temperature with LCO electrode, which were utilized as coating layers to transform the stress and strain experienced during the high-voltage charging and discharging processes into polarization fields, thereby enhancing the electrochemical functionality. Taking the LTO coating layer as an example, the 2 wt% LTO-LCO electrode exhibits an obvious elevation of electrochemical, achieving 172.8 mAh·g−1 at 0.1 C (135.8 mAh·g−1 at 5 C) and maintaining a capacity retention rate of 84.8 % (1 C = 274 mAh·g−1, 3.0–4.5 V) after 200 cycles. This research proves that the low-temperature piezoelectric/ferroelectric materials can be used as a coating layer of LCO electrodes to transform the stress and strain into polarization fields, which reduce the lattice expansion and accelerate the Li+ transport for designing high-performance LCO batteries in the future.

# INTRODUCTION
With the rapid progression of renewable energy, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) with high energy densities have been extensively employed in power storage systems, electric vehicles, and portable electronic devices. As a pivotal cathode material for lithium batteries, LiCoO2 (LCO) garnered significant attention due to its high energy density, exceptional cyclic stability, and elevated voltage platform. The theoretical specific capacity of LCO cathode material is 274 mAh\xb7gE^{\u22121}, but its practical specific capacity, measured at 4.2 V, stands at approximately 140 mAh\xb7gE^{\u22121}, representing merely 50 % of its theoretical potential. In recent decades, the operational voltage of LCO increased from 4.2 V to 4.4 V, which corresponds with the practical capacity at this voltage typically amounting to roughly 60 % of the theoretical capacity. However, high voltage also means a high degree of delithiation, and the insertion and extraction of LiE^{+} during cycling can cause lattice expansion and a series of phase transitions, leading to significant stress\u2013strain accumulation in the crystal structure. Simultaneously, side reactions between the cathode material and the electrolyte increased, along with issues such as lattice oxygen loss, which led to a rapid decline in the cycling capacity of the LCO cathode material. With the introduction of metal oxide (Co3O4 , ZrO2 , TiO2 , etc.), metal fluoride (CaF2 , AlF3 , etc.), and fast ion conductor (Li2ZrO3 , LiVO3 , LiAlO2 , etc.) and other materials for covering, which not only reduces the side reactions between the particle surface of electrode material and the electrolyte using as physical isolation but also improves the efficiency of LiE^{+} diffusion. For example, Zhou et al. prepared Al2O3 nanoparticles as a coating layer of the LCO cathode and demonstrated a capacity retention rate of 82.6 % after 500 cycles at 1 C. Dai et al. prepared a CaF2-coated NCM811 sample by a simple wet chemical method. They showed a specific discharge capacity of 192.8 mAh\xb7gE^{\u22121} and coulomb efficiency of 86.42 %, which reduced the occurrence of side reactions, however, they did not improve the LiE^{+} diffusion efficiency. Song et al. prepared Li2ZrO3 coated LiNi0.7Co0.15Mn0.15O2 samples by sol\u2013gel method and precipitation method, and the capacity retention rate of the whole battery assembled by this method was 73.3 % after 1500 cycles at C/3 ratio. On the other hand, the stress generated by lithium-ion decoupling during the charge\u2013discharge cycle can also be converted into an internal polarization field. Recently, some LIB electrode materials have been modified using piezoelectric or ferroelectric as coating layers to transform the internal stress into polarization fields. For example, Ma et al. designed a diaphragm coating layer with BaTiO3, its piezoelectric property accelerates the redox kinetics of lithium-sulfur batteries and constructs the built-in electric field to improve the LiE^{+} transport, achieving a high-capacity retention rate after 400 cycles at 1 C. Lee et al. also proved that the composited silicon and BaTiO3 anodes can build a local electric field to improve the diffusion efficiency of LiE^{+}. However, the synthesis temperature of BaTiO3 typically exceeds 850 \xb0C, which can cause the thermal decomposition of LCO material during the coating process , making it less than ideal for coating LCO. In this study, we chose piezoelectric material LiTaO3 (LTO) and ferroelectric materials SrTiO3 (STO) and MgTiO3 (MTO) first due to their lower synthesis temperatures. The fabrication of LTO, STO, and MTO as coating layers for LCO operates at 500, 700, and 700 \xb0C respectively, preventing the thermal decomposition of LCO during the coating process. First, LTO with synthesis temperature at about 500 \xb0C was used to demonstrate the easy possession as a coating layer of LCO electrode. The strong spontaneous polarization and excellent piezoelectric properties allow the coating layer to convert the stress generated during high-pressure charging and discharging of LCO into a polarizing electric field, thereby increasing the diffusion rate of LiE^{+} in the LCO material.

# CONCLUSION
In this work, the piezoelectric and ferroelectric materials were employed as a coating layer on the surface of the LCO electrode to enhance its electrochemical performance. Characterization tests were primarily conducted using LTO-LCO as an example. The polarization fields generated from the piezoelectric and ferroelectric coating layer provided a kinetic perspective to facilitate LiE^{+} transport, thereby reducing the diffusion barriers for LiE^{+} at the SEI membrane during the charge\u2013discharge processes. Simultaneously, the coating served as a physical barrier, reducing the side reactions between LCO and the electrolyte, thereby enhancing the stability of the battery. As a result, the optimal 2 wt% LTO-LCO electrode demonstrated a discharge-specific capacity of 172.8 mAh\xb7gE^{\u22121} and retained 84.8 % of its initial capacity when cycled 200 times at a rate of 0.1 C (135.8 mAh\xb7gE^{\u22121} at 5 C). This also validated the general applicability of piezoelectric and ferroelectric materials in the field of LIBs and provided new avenues for solutions.
