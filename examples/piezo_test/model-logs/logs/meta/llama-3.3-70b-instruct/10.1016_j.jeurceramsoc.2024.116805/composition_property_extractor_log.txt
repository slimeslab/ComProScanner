# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
displays XRD patterns of the B-site substitution ceramics in the 2\u03b8 range of 20\u201370E^{\u25e6}. The diffraction peaks shift to a lower angle with the addition of ZrE^{4+} or HfE^{4+}. According to the Bragg equation of 2dsin\u03b8 = n\u03bb, the change of lattice parameters can be reflected by the shift of diffraction angle. Thus, the positions of (111) and (200) peaks shifting indicate the increase of the lattice parameter for the ZrE^{4+} or HfE^{4+} doped samples. In contrast to TiE^{4+}, ZrE^{4+} or HfE^{4+} have the larger ionic radii, leading to the lattice expansion. Because the radius of SbE^{5+} or TaE^{5+} is similar to that of TiE^{4+} , the (111) peaks and (200) peaks exhibit no obvious movement. Tetragonal and rhombohedral phases coexist in BNKT system. With the substitution of SbE^{5+}, the proportion of R3c decreases, while that of P4bm increases. Similarly, rhombohedral, tetragonal P4bm and cubic (or pseudo-cubic) phases coexist in the TaE^{5+} doped BNKT ceramics. Previous research has reported that in ZrE^{4+} modified BNKT ceramics, the contents of both tetragonal and cubic phases have increased. Previous study has shown that the introduction of HfE^{4+} increases the cubic phase content. shows the field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) images of the thermally etched BNKT-xB ceramic samples. The average grain sizes increase with increasing SbE^{5+}, TaE^{5+}, ZrE^{4+}, or HfE^{4+} concentration. This result is consistent with previous studies , suggesting that SbE^{5+}, TaE^{5+}, ZrE^{4+}, or HfE^{4+} substitution promotes grain growth. demonstrates the temperature dependence of the dielectric constant and dielectric loss of poled BNKT-xB ceramic upon the heating process at a frequency of 1\u2013100 kHz. The \u03b5 r at T m decreases with the increase of the content of SbE^{5+}, TaE^{5+}, ZrE^{4+}, or HfE^{4+}. Generally, BNT-based materials have three kinds of dielectric peaks, including T d, T s (the first maximum dielectric temperature), and T m (the second maximum dielectric temperature). The temperature related to the low-temperature dielectric anomaly is termed the T s due to the occurrence of a \u201cdielectric shoulder\u201d. It can be observed that the T d appears in the samples with 1 % ZrE^{4+} and HfE^{4+}, which represents the ferroelectric-relaxor phase transition. The thermal energy destroys the long-range order between the dipoles, so the volume fraction of the polar nanoscale regions (PNRs) increases. The T d of samples with 1 % ZrE^{4+} or HfE^{4+} doped are 55 \u2103 and 50 \u2103 respectively. T d cannot be observed in other samples with 1.5 % doping content, indicating that when ZrE^{4+} or HfE^{4+} are introduced, it is difficult to construct a stable long-term ferroelectric order because of the random strain field inside. Large ferroelectric domains are decomposed into small nanodomains, resulting in microscopically PNRs with short-range ferroelectric order. However, for 1 % SbE^{5+} or TaE^{5+} doped samples, only two dielectric peaks, T s and T m, are observed. It is mainly attributed to the random electric field caused by SbE^{5+} and TaE^{5+} doping inhibits the construction of ferroelectric order, resulting in the depolarization process occurring below room temperature. When four ions of the same content are introduced, the effect of SbE^{5+} or TaE^{5+} on T d and electrical properties is higher than that of ZrE^{4+} or HfE^{4+}. This illustrates that the influence of SbE^{5+} and TaE^{5+} on the destruction of ferroelectric order and the construction of relaxor state is higher than that of ZrE^{4+} and HfE^{4+}. To quantify the variation of relaxation degree, the modified Curie-Weiss law is applied: 1/\u03b5 r-1/\u03b5 rmax=(T-T m) E^{\u03b3}/C, where C is Curie-like constant, and \u03b3 is the diffuseness factor. The curve fitting results as well as the dispersion factors are shown in , which depicts the plots of ln (1/\u03b5 r-1/\u03b5 rmax) as a function of ln (T-T m) at 10 kHz. According to previous studies, \u03b3=1 and \u03b3=2 represent the normal ferroelectric state relaxor state, respectively. Considering the errors during the linear fitting, the diffuseness factor values in all the studied samples are greater than 1.8, further confirming the relaxor feature of the BNKT-xB ceramics system. It can be seen that the \u03b3 of all samples is greater than 1.8, and all except the HfE^{4+} doped samples show a continuously increasing trend. The d 33 of BNKT ceramics is more than 180 pC/N ( (a)). With the increase of 1 % SbE^{5+} or TaE^{5+}, the d 33 drops rapidly. However, the introduction of the same amount of ZrE^{4+} or HfE^{4+} makes d 33 decrease slightly. When the content of ZrE^{4+} or HfE^{4+} reaches 3 %, the d 33 decreases sharply. The addition of SbE^{5+}, TaE^{5+}, ZrE^{4+}, or HfE^{4+} seriously damages the piezoelectricity. Compared with ZrE^{4+} or HfE^{4+}, the effect of SbE^{5+} and TaE^{5+} on reducing piezoelectricity is more significant. The rapid rise of d 33* is accompanied by a sharp decline of d 33 ((b)), which suggests that the appearance of d 33* is accompanied by the breakdown of ferroelectricity and the coexistence of ferroelectric and relaxor states. The bipolar electro-strain loops are measured at an electric field of 70 kV/cm, as shown in (c-d). When the introduction of doping ions reaches 3 %, the bipolar S-E loops change from butterfly-shaped to sprout-shaped, which means that the content has been transformed into an ergodic relaxor. Due to the excessive doping of SbE^{5+} and TaE^{5+}, the strains are significantly reduced. Thus, as the content of SbE^{5+} or TaE^{5+} increases, the macroscopic ferroelectric polarity decreases and the relaxor-ferroelectric transition temperature is lowered below room temperature, resulting in the electro-strain declines. The Ta=0.01 sample has the largest unipolar electro-strain (S uni), up to 0.49 %, and the inverse piezoelectric coefficient d 33* is 612 pm/V. The Zr=0.03 sample has a maximum S uni of 0.448 % and d 33* of 560 pm/V. The maximum S uni of Sb=0.01 and Hf=0.03 samples are 0.404 % and 0.377 %, respectively, and d 33* is 506 pm/V and 471 pm/V, respectively. Finally, BNKT ceramics have a maximum S uni of 0.236 % and d 33* of 295 pm/V. This is because the ferroelectric domains in BNKT are aligned along the last applied positive electric field, and the polarization is close to saturation and cannot quickly return to the initial state, therefore, the electro-strain exhibits an approximately linear response under the new positive electric field, or the polarization elongation of ferroelectric domains with slight switch. Hence, from a microscopic perspective, the strain =Latticeparametersafterapplyinganelectricfield\u2212Initiallatticeparameters Initiallatticeparameters. shows the J-E loops with the composition and temperature, respectively, and the driving electric field for the ER-FE phase transition derived from the J-E loops. For the BNKT sample, a single peak (P 1) is detected in the J-E loops at the transition field in the positive direction and a second peak appears in the subsequent negative electric field direction at room temperature, which can be ascribed to the domain switching at E=E C. The single peak P 1 represents macroscopic ferroelectric domains switching appears in the BNKT ceramics. With the introduction of SbE^{5+}, TaE^{5+}, ZrE^{4+}, or HfE^{4+}, P 1 start to split (marked in Fig. 5(a), P 2, and P 3). The larger peak P 2 is on behalf of ferroelectric to relaxor phase transition, and the other peak P 3 represents relaxor to ferroelectric phase transition. For 3 % ZrE^{4+}, or HfE^{4+} doped samples, the emergence of the peak P 2 in negative side, corresponding to the gradual transition from NR state to ER state, as shown in (b). P 2 tends to decrease or even become negative, which means that after the electric field is removed, the long-range order induced by the electric field cannot be maintained spontaneously, indicating that the PNRs correlation length of the dynamic active state decreases, and the ER phase and FE phase can be reversibly transformed, which can be explained by their close free energy. P 3 is transferred to a high electric field, and its peak value gradually becomes weaker, which indicates that due to the large difference in free energy between ER phase and FE phase, a higher electric field is needed to induce long-range ordering. The stability of PNRs decreases with the increase in volume fraction, which has also been observed in other literature. The accurate driving electric field for the ER-FE phase transition should be justified via the J-E loops, as shown in (c). The addition of SbE^{5+}, TaE^{5+}, ZrE^{4+}, or HfE^{4+} alters the driving field of the BNKT, and it is generally higher in the SbE^{5+}or TaE^{5+} doped samples than in the ZrE^{4+} or HfE^{4+} doped samples. The key factor for strain properties should be only the lattice discrepancies between the initial relaxor state and the critical ferroelectric state. (d) depicts the temperature-dependent J-E loops from 30 \xb0C to 110 \xb0C for BNKT-xB ceramics under an electric field of 70 kV/cm. Around 70 \u2103, the splitting of the original peak and the appearance of new peaks are detected in the BNKT sample. For all samples, with increasing temperature, the polarization dynamics increase, which leads to a decrease of transition hysteresis between a long-range ordered FE and a short-range ordered relaxor state. The P 2 becomes more negative with temperature rise, which means that thermal fluctuation can facilitate the recovery from induced long-range order to dynamically active PNRs, accompanied by the increasing fraction and reducing volume of PNRs. To prove the strain value is determined by the lattice structure before and after the application of electric field, we tested the ex-situ XRD of representative samples before and after polarizing to reveal variation in phase structures. The representative Ta=0.01 and Hf=0.03 samples are chosen for their maximum d 33* difference. The figures below display the difference between unpoled and poled samples, and the Rietveld XRD results of poled Ta=0.01 and Hf=0.03 samples, respectively. (a) displays the difference between unpoled and poled Ta=0.01 and Hf=0.03 samples. After poling, the (002) and (200) peaks split, indicating a probably tetragonal dominant phase structure for Ta=0.01 and Hf=0.03 samples. Therefore, the combination of space groups R3c, P4mm, P4bm are used to fit the XRD patterns to render the best possible fit. The fitting results exhibit the tetragonal phase (P4bm+P4mm) occupies the largest proportion of the phase structure. The sequence of phase transitions from a cubic (or pseudo-cubic) structure to a tetragonal structure with TaE^{5+} or HfE^{4+} doping, which should be the origin of the enhanced electro-strain behaviors in the ceramics. However, the lattice structure of BNT-based relaxers is difficult to define quantitatively, let alone accurately characterize structural discrepancies. To investigate the effect of the introduced B-site ions on the ferroelectricity of and temperature stability, the P-E loops at the maximum strain of different doping systems were measured at varying temperatures (from 30 to 110 \u2103), as shown in. The strain reaches its maximum value when the doping amount of Sb or Ta reaches 1 %, or the doping amount of ZrE^{4+} or HfE^{4+} reaches 3 %. The polarization and the maximum unipolar strain continue to decrease as the introduction of SbE^{5+} and TaE^{5+} continues to increase. The introduction of SbE^{5+}, TaE^{5+}, ZrE^{4+}, or HfE^{4+} leads to disruption of the ferroelectric state, resulting in the formation of the relaxor state. When the addition of ZrE^{4+} or HfE^{4+} reaches 3 %, or the addition of SbE^{5+} and TaE^{5+} reaches 1 %, the P-E loops become slender and show an obvious double-like hysteresis loop. This indicates that the inherent ferroelectricity of the BNKT ceramics is destroyed, causing a transition from the ferroelectric to the relaxor state , which is essential for obtaining large strain. exhibits the temperature-dependence (S-E) loop of S uni for BNKT, Ta=0.01, Sb=0.01, Zr=0.03, and Hf=0.03 samples, which are measured at an electric field of 80 kV/cm. For BNKT ceramics, the S uni increases continuously with temperature, indicating that the depolarization range is not reached before 110 \u2103. For BNKT ceramics, the strain continues to increase with temperature and is insensitive to frequency changes. With the addition of SbE^{5+}, TaE^{5+}, ZrE^{4+}, or HfE^{4+}, when the temperature rises, the thermal stability of electrical properties decreases and becomes sensitive to frequency changes, and its temperature stability decreases with increasing frequency. The frequency stability of samples doped with ZrE^{4+} or SbE^{4+} is slightly higher than that of samples doped with SbE^{5+} or TaE^{5+}.

# INTRODUCTION
In the past few decades, lead-based piezoelectric ceramics such as Pb(ZrTi)O3 and PbMg1/3Nb2/3O3-PbTiO3 have been widely used in electromechanical actuator applications due to their high electro-strain performance. Some typical perovskite ferroelectrics (e.g., K0.5Na0.5NbO3 (KNN), BaTiO3 (BT), Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 (BNT), are considered as potential alternatives to lead-based piezoelectric materials. For piezoelectricity performances, KNN-based materials are thought to be one of the leading lead-free candidates due to their high Curie temperature and good piezoelectric properties. BT-based ferroelectric is regarded as a dielectric material) are regarded as potential alternatives to lead-based piezoelectric materials. Among these materials, BNT-based materials show special superiority in electro-strain performances, which even exceeds traditional Pb-based piezoelectric ceramics, including Pb(Zr1-xTix)O3 and electrostrictive Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3. According to the mainstream, the giant strain of BNT-based systems is considered to arise from a relaxor-ferroelectric transition , and regarding to the relaxor-ferroelectric transition, the classical relaxor theory points the random fields is the critical factor. However, in fact, the transition temperature (depolarization temperature, T d) can be regulated to room temperature by various methods (e.g., the addition of perovskite ABO3 type content , cations in A-site or B-site doping , texture , etc), but the effect of strain enhancement varies greatly. For instance, 0.02 mol% SnE^{4+} doping has proved to be beneficial in improving the electro-strain behavior of BNT-based ceramic, and the d 33 E^{\u2217} got to 462 pm/V. The strain of BNT-based ceramics with 0.02 mol% LaE^{3+} doping can reach 0.42 % at 70 kV/cm, and correspondingly, the d 33 E^{\u2217} is 600 pm/V. To investigate the effect of the local random field on the relaxor-ferroelectric transition and the strain value, we selected SbE^{5+}, TaE^{5+}, ZrE^{4+}, and HfE^{4+} as an additive. Bi0.5(Na0.8K0.2)0.5TiO3 is located at the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) and thus possesses excellent electromechanical properties , which is the reason why most references chose it as the matrix. Herein we also chose Bi0.5(Na0.8K0.2)0.5TiO3 as the matrix. The ionic radii of SbE^{5+}, TaE^{5+}, and TiE^{4+} are similar but the electric valency is different, so the random electric field is considered to be the main factor in the relaxor-ferroelectric transition. While ZrE^{4+}, HfE^{4+}, and TiE^{4+} have the same electric valency but a large difference in ionic radius. Overall, it is believed that the doping of SbE^{5+}, TaE^{5+}, ZrE^{4+}, or HfE^{4+} can further modify the relaxor behaviors, and then realize the enhancement of the electro-strain. Therefore, we designed Bi0.5(Na0.8K0.2)0.5Ti1-x B x O3 (abbreviated as (1-x)BNKT-xB, BSb, Ta, x=0, 0.01, 0.015 and 0.03; BZr, Hf, x=0, 0.01, 0.03 and 0.05, matrix abbreviated as BNKT) ceramic system to investigate the effects of SbE^{5+}, TaE^{5+}, ZrE^{4+} or HfE^{4+} doping on the evolution of electric properties in BNT-based ceramics, which reveals that random electric fields and strain fields can only regulate the relaxor state, and then improve the strain, but cannot directly determine the strain value.

# CONCLUSION
In this work, SbE^{5+}, TaE^{5+}, ZrE^{4+}, and HfE^{4+} are selected as B-doped elements to investigate the effect of random electric field or strain field on the strain value. The ionic radii of SbE^{5+}, TaE^{5+}, and TiE^{4+} are similar but the electro valency is different, so the addition of SbE^{5+} or TaE^{5+} is thought to introduce a random electric field. While ZrE^{4+}, HfE^{4+}, and, TiE^{4+} have the same electric valency but a large difference in ionic radius, so the addition of ZrE^{4+} or HfE^{4+} is thought to introduce a random strain field. The introduction of SbE^{5+}, TaE^{5+}, ZrE^{4+}, and HfE^{4+} destroys the inherent ferroelectricity of BNKT ceramics, resulting in the transition from ferroelectric state to relaxor state. When the content of SbE^{5+} or TaE^{5+} reaches 1 %, and the content of ZrE^{4+} or HfE^{4+} reaches 3 %, the strain reaches the highest value with a sharp decrease in piezoelectric properties. The influence of SbE^{5+} or TaE^{5+} on the destruction of ferroelectric order and the construction of relaxor state is higher than that of ZrE^{4+} or HfE^{4+}. At room temperature, the Ta=0.01 sample has the largest unipolar electro-strain, followed by the Zr=0.03 sample, then the Sb=0.01 and Hf=0.03 samples, and finally BNKT.

To quantify the variation of relaxation degree, the modified Curie-Weiss law is applied: 1/\u03b5 r-1/\u03b5 rmax=(T-T m) E^{\u03b3}/C, where C is Curie-like constant, and \u03b3 is the diffuseness factor. The curve fitting results as well as the dispersion factors are shown in , which depicts the plots of ln (1/\u03b5 r-1/\u03b5 rmax) as a function of ln (T-T m) at 10 kHz. According to previous studies, \u03b3=1 and \u03b3=2 represent the normal ferroelectric state relaxor state, respectively. Considering the errors during the linear fitting, the diffuseness factor values in all the studied samples are greater than 1.8, further confirming the relaxor feature of the BNKT-xB ceramics system. It can be seen that the \u03b3 of all samples is greater than 1.8, and all except the HfE^{4+} doped samples show a continuously increasing trend. The d 33 of BNKT ceramics is more than 180 pC/N ( (a)). With the increase of 1 % SbE^{5+} or TaE^{5+}, the d 33 drops rapidly. However, the introduction of the same amount of ZrE^{4+} or HfE^{4+} makes d 33 decrease slightly. When the content of ZrE^{4+} or HfE^{4+} reaches 3 %, the d 33 decreases sharply. The addition of SbE^{5+}, TaE^{5+}, ZrE^{4+}, or HfE^{4+} seriously damages the piezoelectricity. Compared with ZrE^{4+} or HfE^{4+}, the effect of SbE^{5+} and TaE^{5+} on reducing piezoelectricity is more significant. The rapid rise of d 33* is accompanied by a sharp decline of d 33 ((b)), which suggests that the appearance of d 33* is accompanied by the breakdown of ferroelectricity and the coexistence of ferroelectric and relaxor states. The bipolar electro-strain loops are measured at an electric field of 70 kV/cm, as shown in (c-d). When the introduction of doping ions reaches 3 %, the bipolar S-E loops change from butterfly-shaped to sprout-shaped, which means that the content has been transformed into an ergodic relaxor. Due to the excessive doping of SbE^{5+} and TaE^{5+}, the strains are significantly reduced. Thus, as the content of SbE^{5+} or TaE^{5+} increases, the macroscopic ferroelectric polarity decreases and the relaxor-ferroelectric transition temperature is lowered below room temperature, resulting in the electro-strain declines. The Ta=0.01 sample has the largest unipolar electro-strain (S uni), up to 0.49 %, and the inverse piezoelectric coefficient d 33* is 612 pm/V. The Zr=0.03 sample has a maximum S uni of 0.448 % and d 33* of 560 pm/V. The maximum S uni of Sb=0.01 and Hf=0.03 samples are 0.404 % and 0.377 %, respectively, and d 33* is 506 pm/V and 471 pm/V, respectively. Finally, BNKT ceramics have a maximum S uni of 0.236 % and d 33* of 295 pm/V. This is because the ferroelectric domains in BNKT are aligned along the last applied positive electric field, and the polarization is close to saturation and cannot quickly return to the initial state, therefore, the electro-strain exhibits an approximately linear response under the new positive electric field, or the polarization elongation of ferroelectric domains with slight switch. Hence, from a microscopic perspective, the strain =Latticeparametersafterapplyinganelectricfield\u2212Initiallatticeparameters Initiallatticeparameters. shows the J-E loops with the composition and temperature, respectively, and the driving electric field for the ER-FE phase transition derived from the J-E loops. For the BNKT sample, a single peak (P 1) is detected in the J-E loops at the transition field in the positive direction and a second peak appears in the subsequent negative electric field direction at room temperature, which can be ascribed to the domain switching at E=E C. The single peak P 1 represents macroscopic ferroelectric domains switching appears in the BNKT ceramics. With the introduction of SbE^{5+}, TaE^{5+}, ZrE^{4+}, or HfE^{4+}, P 1 start to split (marked in Fig. 5(a), P 2, and P 3). The larger peak P 2 is on behalf of ferroelectric to relaxor phase transition, and the other peak P 3 represents relaxor to ferroelectric phase transition. For 3 % ZrE^{4+}, or HfE^{4+} doped samples, the emergence of the peak P 2 in negative side, corresponding to the gradual transition from NR state to ER state, as shown in (b). P 2 tends to decrease or even become negative, which means that after the electric field is removed, the long-range order induced by the electric field cannot be maintained spontaneously, indicating that the PNRs correlation length of the dynamic active state decreases, and the ER phase and FE phase can be reversibly transformed, which can be explained by their close free energy. P 3 is transferred to a high electric field, and its peak value gradually becomes weaker, which indicates that due to the large difference in free energy between ER phase and FE phase, a higher electric field is needed to induce long-range ordering. The stability of PNRs decreases with the increase in volume fraction, which has also been observed in other literature. The accurate driving electric field for the ER-FE phase transition should be justified via the J-E loops, as shown in (c). The addition of SbE^{5+}, TaE^{5+}, ZrE^{4+}, or HfE^{4+} alters the driving field of the BNKT, and it is generally higher in the SbE^{5+}or TaE^{5+} doped samples than in the ZrE^{4+} or HfE^{4+} doped samples. The key factor for strain properties should be only the lattice discrepancies between the initial relaxor state and the critical ferroelectric state. (d) depicts the temperature-dependent J-E loops from 30 \xb0C to 110 \xb0C for BNKT-xB ceramics under an electric field of 70 kV/cm. Around 70 \u2103, the splitting of the original peak and the appearance of new peaks are detected in the BNKT sample. For all samples, with increasing temperature, the polarization dynamics increase, which leads to a decrease of transition hysteresis between a long-range ordered FE and a short-range ordered relaxor state. The P 2 becomes more negative with temperature rise, which means that thermal fluctuation can facilitate the recovery from induced long-range order to dynamically active PNRs, accompanied by the increasing fraction and reducing volume of PNRs. To prove the strain value is determined by the lattice structure before and after the application of electric field, we tested the ex-situ XRD of representative samples before and after polarizing to reveal variation in phase structures. The representative Ta=0.01 and Hf=0.03 samples are chosen for their maximum d 33* difference. The figures below display the difference between unpoled and poled samples, and the Rietveld XRD results of poled Ta=0.01 and Hf=0.03 samples, respectively. (a) displays the difference between unpoled and poled Ta=0.01 and Hf=0.03 samples. After poling, the (002) and (200) peaks split, indicating a probably tetragonal dominant phase structure for Ta=0.01 and Hf=0.03 samples. Therefore, the combination of space groups R3c, P4mm, P4bm are used to fit the XRD patterns to render the best possible fit. The fitting results exhibit the tetragonal phase (P4bm+P4mm) occupies the largest proportion of the phase structure. The sequence of phase transitions from a cubic (or pseudo-cubic) structure to a tetragonal structure with TaE^{5+} or HfE^{4+} doping, which should be the origin of the enhanced electro-strain behaviors in the ceramics. However, the lattice structure of BNT-based relaxers is difficult to define quantitatively, let alone accurately characterize structural discrepancies. To investigate the effect of the introduced B-site ions on the ferroelectricity of and temperature stability, the P-E loops at the maximum strain of different doping systems were measured at varying temperatures (from 30 to 110 \u2103), as shown in. The strain reaches its maximum value when the doping amount of Sb or Ta reaches 1 %, or the doping amount of ZrE^{4+} or HfE^{4+} reaches 3 %. The polarization and the maximum unipolar strain continue to decrease as the introduction of SbE^{5+} and TaE^{5+} continues to increase. The introduction of SbE^{5+}, TaE^{5+}, ZrE^{4+}, or HfE^{4+} leads to disruption of the ferroelectric state, resulting in the formation of the relaxor state. When the addition of ZrE^{4+} or HfE^{4+} reaches 3 %, or the addition of SbE^{5+} and TaE^{5+} reaches 1 %, the P-E loops become slender and show an obvious double-like hysteresis loop. This indicates that the inherent ferroelectricity of the BNKT ceramics is destroyed, causing a transition from the ferroelectric to the relaxor state , which is essential for obtaining large strain. exhibits the temperature-dependence (S-E) loop of S uni for BNKT, Ta=0.01, Sb=0.01, Zr=0.03, and Hf=0.03 samples, which are measured at an electric field of 80 kV/cm. For BNKT ceramics, the S uni increases continuously with temperature, indicating that the depolarization range is not reached before 110 \u2103. For BNKT ceramics, the strain continues to increase with temperature and is insensitive to frequency changes. With the addition of SbE^{5+}, TaE^{5+}, ZrE^{4+}, or HfE^{4+}, when the temperature rises, the thermal stability of electrical properties decreases and becomes sensitive to frequency changes, and its temperature stability decreases with increasing frequency. The frequency stability of samples doped with ZrE^{4+} or SbE^{4+} is slightly higher than that of samples doped with SbE^{5+} or TaE^{5+}.

# INTRODUCTION
In the past few decades, lead-based piezoelectric ceramics such as Pb(ZrTi)O3 and PbMg1/3Nb2/3O3-PbTiO3 have been widely used in electromechanical actuator applications due to their high electro-strain performance. Some typical perovskite ferroelectrics (e.g., K0.5Na0.5NbO3 (KNN), BaTiO3 (BT), Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 (BNT), are considered as potential alternatives to lead-based piezoelectric materials. For piezoelectricity performances, KNN-based materials are thought to be one of the leading lead-free candidates due to their high Curie temperature and good piezoelectric properties. BT-based ferroelectric is regarded as a dielectric material) are regarded as potential alternatives to lead-based piezoelectric materials. Among these materials, BNT-based materials show special superiority in electro-strain performances, which even exceeds traditional Pb-based piezoelectric ceramics, including Pb(Zr1-xTix)O3 and electrostrictive Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3. According to the mainstream, the giant strain of BNT-based systems is considered to arise from a relaxor-ferroelectric transition , and regarding to the relaxor-ferroelectric transition, the classical relaxor theory points the random fields is the critical factor. However, in fact, the transition temperature (depolarization temperature, T d) can be regulated to room temperature by various methods (e.g., the addition of perovskite ABO3 type content , cations in A-site or B-site doping , texture , etc), but the effect of strain enhancement varies greatly. For instance, 0.02 mol% SnE^{4+} doping has proved to be beneficial in improving the electro-strain behavior of BNT-based ceramic, and the d 33 E^{\u2217} got to 462 pm/V. The strain of BNT-based ceramics with 0.02 mol% LaE^{3+} doping can reach 0.42 % at 70 kV/cm, and correspondingly, the d 33 E^{\u2217} is 600 pm/V. To investigate the effect of the local random field on the relaxor-ferroelectric transition and the strain value, we selected SbE^{5+}, TaE^{5+}, ZrE^{4+}, and HfE^{4+} as an additive. Bi0.5(Na0.8K0.2)0.5TiO3 is located at the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) and thus possesses excellent electromechanical properties , which is the reason why most references chose it as the matrix. Herein we also chose Bi0.5(Na0.8K0.2)0.5TiO3 as the matrix. The ionic radii of SbE^{5+}, TaE^{5+}, and TiE^{4+} are similar but the electric valency is different, so the random electric field is considered to be the main factor in the relaxor-ferroelectric transition. While ZrE^{4+}, HfE^{4+}, and TiE^{4+} have the same electric valency but a large difference in ionic radius. Overall, it is believed that the doping of SbE^{5+}, TaE^{5+}, ZrE^{4+}, or HfE^{4+} can further modify the relaxor behaviors, and then realize the enhancement of the electro-strain. Therefore, we designed Bi0.5(Na0.8K0.2)0.5Ti1-x B x O3 (abbreviated as (1-x)BNKT-xB, BSb, Ta, x=0, 0.01, 0.015 and 0.03; BZr, Hf, x=0, 0.01, 0.03 and 0.05, matrix abbreviated as BNKT) ceramic system to investigate the effects of SbE^{5+}, TaE^{5+}, ZrE^{4+} or HfE^{4+} doping on the evolution of electric properties in BNT-based ceramics, which reveals that random electric fields and strain fields can only regulate the relaxor state, and then improve the strain, but cannot directly determine the strain value.

# CONCLUSION
In this work, SbE^{5+}, TaE^{5+}, ZrE^{4+}, and HfE^{4+} are selected as B-doped elements to investigate the effect of random electric field or strain field on the strain value. The ionic radii of SbE^{5+}, TaE^{5+}, and TiE^{4+} are similar but the electro valency is different, so the addition of SbE^{5+} or TaE^{5+} is thought to introduce a random electric field. While ZrE^{4+}, HfE^{4+}, and, TiE^{4+} have the same electric valency but a large difference in ionic radius, so the addition of ZrE^{4+} or HfE^{4+} is thought to introduce a random strain field. The introduction of SbE^{5+}, TaE^{5+}, ZrE^{4+}, and HfE^{4+} destroys the inherent ferroelectricity of BNKT ceramics, resulting in the transition from ferroelectric state to relaxor state. When the content of SbE^{5+} or TaE^{5+} reaches 1 %, and the content of ZrE^{4+} or HfE^{4+} reaches 3 %, the strain reaches the highest value with a sharp decrease in piezoelectric properties. The influence of SbE^{5+} or TaE^{5+} on the destruction of ferroelectric order and the construction of relaxor state is higher than that of ZrE^{4+} or HfE^{4+}. At room temperature, the Ta=0.01 sample has the largest unipolar electro-strain, followed by the Zr=0.03 sample, then the Sb=0.01 and Hf=0.03 samples, and finally BNKT.
