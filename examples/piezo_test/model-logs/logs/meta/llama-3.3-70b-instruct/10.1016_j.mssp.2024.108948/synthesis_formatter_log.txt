Modify the 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' if allowed entities are provided specifically, else keep the same.

**Parameters**: - Extracted synthesis data containing method, precursors, steps and characterization techniques:  {'synthesis_extracted_data': {'method': 'conventional solid phase sintering', 'precursors': ['Bi2O3', 'Fe2O3', 'TiO2', 'BaCO3', 'Al2O3', 'ZnO'], 'steps': ['weighing of raw materials according to the chemical formula', 'ball-milling for 24 h', 'pre-firing in a muffle furnace at 780°C for 4h', 'adding 8 wt% of polyvinyl alcohol as a binder', 'pressing into 8 mm diameter disks at a uniaxial pressure of 12 MPa', 'sintering at 600°C for 3 h to remove the PVA and at 1000°C for 6 h to obtain ceramic wafers', 'polarization by placing in silicon oil at 120°C and holding at a DC field of 5 kV/cm for 20 min'], 'characterization_techniques': ['XRD', 'SEM', 'TEM', 'LCR analyzer', 'ferroelectric detection system']}}
**Notes**:
- Only modify 'methods' and 'characterization_techniques' values to match allowed entities
- Keep 'steps' and 'precursors' values unmodified
