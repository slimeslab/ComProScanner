# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
shows the XRD 2\u03b8 patterns ranging from 20\xb0 to 65\xb0 of BNT-ST-100xBT lead-free piezoelectric thin films. It can be seen in (a) that four peaks appear at 2\u03b8 = 22.8\xb0, 32.5\xb0, 46.6\xb0, and 57.9\xb0, corresponding to the (001), (110), (002), and (112) reflections of the BNT-ST-100xBT films respectively. The diffraction peak of Pt (111) was detected at 39.9\xb0. There no second-phase peaks were detected by XRD, indicating that BT had completely dissolved in the BNT-20ST crystal matrix, forming a uniform and stable solid solution with a single perovskite structure. The XRD patterns confirm the polycrystalline structure in all thin films without any preferred orientation. Analysis of the (111) and (002) peaks is a useful method to distinguish the tetragonal and rhombohedral phases in BNT-based materials. In order to better understand the symmetry structure of BNT-ST-100xBT, the XRD slow scan results of the thin films at 2\u03b8 = 45.7\xb0 - 47.4\xb0 were plotted in (b). Prado et al. , the amplified (002) peaks of all the thin films were fitted well using a single peak without obvious splitting characteristics, indicating that the thin films have a pseudocubic structure. It was reported that a pseudocubic structure existed in BNT-ST-BT ceramics with low BT content, while when the BT content increased by more than 8 %, a tetragonal structure arose. However, in our BNT-ST-BT thin film with BT ranging from 2 % to 11 %, pseudocubic dominant. It is commonly observed in BNT-based thin films as an approach-cubic structure due to the tiny lattice distortion of BNT-based material and small grains of thin films. In addition, with the increase of BT content, the BaE^{2+}(r=1.35 \xc5) enters the BNT-ST lattice and replaces the original NaE^{+} (r = 0.95 \xc5), BiE^{3+} (r = 1.08 \xc5) and SrE^{2+} (r = 1.13 \xc5) at A site. The larger ionic radius of BaE^{2+} expands the crystal lattice of the film, causing the XRD peaks to shift to lower 2\u03b8 values. The surface morphologies of BNT-ST-100xBT (x = 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.11) thin films were shown in (a-e), and the related corresponding grain size count were exhibited in (f). The particles of all films were uniform, with a statistical distribution size below 70 nm, and varied little in the film composition. (g-k) shows the cross-sectional morphologies of BNT-ST-100xBT films with Pt/TiO2/SiO2/Si structure. The thickness of thin films was determined from the images in the range of 0.69\u20130.76 \u03bcm. One is the Scherrer equation based on XRD patterns , and another is dimensioning from the SEM images. Except for a discrepancy in BNT-ST-11BT thin film, the mean grain sizes were around 40 nm for the films. depicts the dielectric constant and loss versus temperature for the BNT-ST-100xBT (x = 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.11) thin films from 25\xb0C to 200\xb0C at various frequencies of 1 kHz, 10 kHz and 100 kHz. As shown in (a)-(e), the dielectric constants of all films exhibited similar behavior as a function of the temperature, i.e., firstly increased and then decreased, while at the same temperature, the dielectric constant (\u03b5r) decreased when increasing the frequency. At room temperature, BNT-ST-6BT thin films represented the largest value among all films at each frequency, demonstrating their good polarization property. All films showed rather low dielectric loss (<0.04), which is related to the high quality and dense structure of the film prepared in this work. One dielectric anomaly appeared at the temperature of T m, at which the maximum permittivity (\u03b5m) was observed in all the thin films. In the thin films with x = 0.02\u20130.08, as the BT content increased, the dielectric peak moved toward lower temperatures. To further explore the relaxation properties of the films, the relaxation degree was calculated through the modified Curie-Weiss law : Where \u03b5 r is the relative dielectric permittivity at the temperature T (T > T m ), and C is the Curie-like constant. The coefficient \u03b3 reflects the ferroelectricity degree or relaxation degree of the material, for which close to 1 means ideal normal ferroelectricity, and close to 2 indicates that the material has classic relaxation properties. The BNT-ST-2BT thin film with a lower \u03b3 value is due to the coexistence of ferroelectric and relaxor state, while the thin films with BT content of more than 4 % with \u03b3 value close to 2 demonstrate an approach-ergodic relaxor characteristic. (a-j) exhibits the curves of the dielectric constant and dielectric loss of the BNT-ST-100xBT (x = 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.11) thin films as a function of DC electric field from \u2212300 kV\xb7cmE^{\u22121} to 300 kV\xb7cmE^{\u22121} (\u03b5 r-E curves) at room temperature. The \u03b5 r-E curves of BNT-ST-2BT thin film presented a "butterfly" shape with obvious hysteresis, while, when the BT content increased, a \u201cdouble butterfly\u201d shape appeared, and the feature became more apparent. The dielectric loss vs. electric field curves exhibited a \u201cdouble butterfly\u201d shape in all films, and the feature became more apparent with BT content increasing. The dielectric constant and loss curves of BNT-ST-2BT thin films in (a) and (f) show two broadened \u03b5 peaks and four loss peaks. The characteristics are similar to those reported in BNT-based materials around depoling temperature , where nonergodic and ergodic relaxation states coexist. For BNT-ST-100xBT (x = 0.04\u20130.11) thin films in (b-e) and (g-j), four peaks in the dielectric constant and loss curves appeared due to the branches on the decreasing field, which is the feature of BNT-based materials at a temperature higher than depoling temperature with ergodic relaxor state. The ferroelectric properties of BNT-ST-100xBT (x = 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.11) thin films were characterized, and the P-E loos, maximum polarization (P max), remanent polarization (P r), P max-P r and coercive field (E c) values at a maximum applied electric field (E max) of 600 kV/cm were displayed in (a, b). With the increase of BT content, the ordered ferroelectric domain was destroyed, while the P max and P r showed a decreasing trend. The BNT-ST-2BT thin film exhibited the strongest ferroelectricity, with the P max and P r larger than the other four films, indicating that more ferroelectric domains along the polarization field are maintained after the electric field is removed in the film. The minimum \u03b3 in  for BNT-ST-2BT thin film conforms with the strongest ferroelectricity related to domain motion. The thin films with x = 0.04 \u223c 0.11 exhibited low-hysteresis P-E loops with a slim shape, low P r, and high E c, related to the relaxor ferroelectric feature with ergodic polar nanoregions (PNRs). The redirect of the PNRs when an electric field is applied contributes to the generation of polarization. The weakly correlated ergodic PNRs return to the disordered state upon the removal of the applied field, thus giving rise to the near-zero remanent polarization. The P max and P r of other components (x = 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, and 0.11) were not much different, but relatively large P max and P r can still be observed at x = 0.06, which is closely related to the maximum dielectric constant shown in (c). Moreover, the composition x = 0.06 exhibited a low E c , demonstrating the dominative of ergodic relaxor phase, which is in favor of hysteresis-free electrostrain. (c-g) describes the polarization loops of BNT-ST-100xBT thin films under different E max. Bipolar strain curves were obtained by applying 600 kV/cm for the BNT-ST-100xBT (x = 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.11) thin films. The fitting of the strain curve at x = 0.11 with a parabolic function was shown in (a) as an example. Based on the data of the S-E loops in (a) and the corresponding P-E loops at an E max of 600 kV/cm in (a), the S-P E^{2} curves were calculated and shown in (b). The strain to the square of the polarization for the film at x = 0.02 deviated slightly from linearity, which is related to its strongest ferroelectricity. Films of other components (x = 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, and 0.11) all showed a highly linear relationship of S-P E^{2} curves, indicating pure electrostrictive behavior with short-range ordered polarization. The electrostrictive coefficients Q were calculated from the S-P E^{2} curves according to formula (1) and shown in. BNT-ST-6BT thin films have achieved the largest electrostrictive coefficient, 0.21 mE^{4}/CE^{2}, which is an order of magnitude higher than that obtained in ceramics. The unipolar strain of BNT-ST-100xBT (x = 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.11) thin films at an E max of 600 kV/cm and 1800 kV/cm were shown in (c). The unipolar strain curves measured at 600 kV/cm exhibited a parabolic shape behavior, which is similar to that of bipolar strain curves. With the increase of the applied electric field from 600 kV/cm to 1800 kV/cm, the strains increased linearly, which is an advantage for actuating applications. Furthermore, the hysteresis of the unipolar strain curve was small, which indicates a good application potential of BNT-ST-100xBT thin films. By linearly fitting the strain curve under the electric field from 600 kV/cm to 1800 kV/cm in (c), the piezoelectric coefficient d 33 of each component can be obtained, as shown in. The largest d 33 value was obtained in x = 0.02 film. Beyond that, the x = 0.06 films exhibited the biggest d 33 value in the besides components. Furthermore, by changing the E max, a series of unipolar S-E curves of BNT-ST-6BT thin films were acquired and presented in (d). The S-E curves below 600 kV/cm appeared parabolic in shape, while, as the applied electric field increased to 2400 kV/cm, the strain increased linearly until a remarkable strain value of 0.82 % was achieved. To understand the domain and polarization behavior in these relaxor thin films, the BNT-ST-100xBT (x = 0.02, 0.06, 0.11) films were studied by PFM. Clear grain boundaries can be observed in the topography images, with the grain size being tens of nanometers, which is in agreement with that calculated from SEM images. The phase images of the three films in (d-f) emerged as a \u201cmosaic-like\u201d form, meaning no domain feature can be determined from the phase images. The blue circled region in (h) of BNT-ST-2BT thin films appeared to have a distinct amplitude response in nm-sized, which would be likely related to nanodomains. The remaining region without amplitude signal may be related to PNRs, which are below the resolution of PFM measurements (tens of nanometers, depending on the tip and measurement parameters), appearing as noise form. No mesoscopic domain feature can be observed for BNT-ST-100xBT (x = 0.06, 0.11) films in (i, j), which could be in PNRs form. The domain characterization of these films was in the size of tens of nanometers or in PNRs, which was related to their relaxor behavior increasing with BT content. The BNT-ST-BT thin films in this work exhibit outstanding electrostrictive coefficients. Furthermore, the BNT-ST-6BT thin films can take both sides of high giant electrostrictive coefficients and excellent electrostrain properties. The binary BNT-ST solid solution is regarded as a potential base for high strain performance, with composition located on the ferroelectric and relaxor phase boundary with an ST content of 20\u223c25 %. By introducing BT into the binary solid solution to form ternary materials, the polarization decreased with increasing BT content. When the BT content increased higher than 2 %, the P-E loops became slim, and diffusion coefficient \u03b3 was close to 2, which are characteristics of a relaxor material. In this work, as expected, except for the BNT-ST-2BT thin film, the compositions, including x from 0.04 to 0.11, exhibited a predominant relaxor behavior with \u03b3 approaching 2. The polarization distribution of these ergodic relaxor thin films is in the form of nanodomains/PNRs, as shown in (b). As a result, giant Q values were obtained in the BNT-ST-100xBT (x = 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.11) thin films, largely higher than the results reported. Compared to the above composition, the lower electrostrictive coefficient in x = 0.02 is due to its lower relaxor degree, which, in turn, is beneficial to the highest piezoelectric coefficient in this film. The low dielectric constant, lower than 200 at 1 kHz in the BNT-ST-BT thin films, is beneficial in reaching a large electrostrictive coefficient. In addition, the largest Q was obtained in BNT-ST-6BT thin films, higher than the other components in the deep ergodic relaxation zone. It was reported in BNT-based materials that the BT content played an effective role in regular polarization and piezoelectric properties. The phase boundary of a ferroelectric/relaxor or nonergodic/ergodic relaxor can be constructed by varying the BT content. The phase diagram of BNT-ST-100xBT ceramics has reported that the pseudocubic and tetragonal phases coexist in the x range of 0.04\u20130.06, in which the composition of a large electrostrain can be obtained by constructing ferroelectrics with ergodic relaxation characteristics. In our BNT-ST-100xBT thin films, a single pseudocubic phase was observed in the films with BT content ranging from 2 % to 11 %. The absence of obvious phase transition in these films from XRD analysis is likely due to the small lattice distortion in this system, a phenomenon which was reported in the BNT-BT-NN ternary solid solutions. An evident performance variation with BT content were pronounced that, which is in BNT-ST-6BT thin films, the largest dielectric constant, the largest polarization variability, the highest piezoelectric coefficient, and the largest strain response were obtained. It is believed the BaE^{2+} diffused into the BNT-ST lattice, increasing the A-site disorder and resulting in a phase disorder transition in microscale at the BNT-ST-6BT compositions. The largest Q obtained in BNT-ST-6BT thin films is due to the largest strain response and low polarization according to formula (1).

# TITLE
Simultaneous giant strain and electrostrictive coefficient in lead-free BNT-ST-BT ergodic relaxor thin films on Pt/TiO<inf>2</inf>/SiO<inf>2</inf>/Si substrates

# ABSTRACT
Lead-free ferroelectric compound Bi1/2Na1/2TiO3 has great potential in realizing large electrostrain response and electrostrictive coefficient. In this work, (0.8-x)Bi1/2Na1/2TiO3-0.2SrTiO3-xBaTiO3 (BNT-ST-100xBT) thin films were prepared by chemical solution deposition method. The most significant electrostrictive effect was obtained in the ergodic relaxor BNT-ST-6BT thin film, i.e., a giant electrostrictive coefficient of 0.21 m4/C2. Meanwhile, by increasing the applied electric field, a linearly increasing strain and the maximum value of 0.82 % were obtained in this film.

# INTRODUCTION
Future Internet of Things (IoT) society requires various integrated micro-electro-mechanical-systems (MEMS) devices like sensors and actuators. As an important family of functional materials, ferroelectric (FE) materials could be applied to various devices thanks to their multiple functionalities, one of which consists in the electric field-induced strain. In particular, the advantages of high strain, fast response speed, and large driving force make FE thin films with the perovskite structure ideal for micro-actuator applications. However, the further performance enhancement of perovskite FE thin films-based actuators faces the challenge of the relatively large hysteresis of electrostrain curves in FE films. The electrostrain of FE materials comes from not only the inverse piezoelectric effect but also from the electrostrictive effect, the phase transition, and the domain wall motion. Researchers have recently developed a series of lead-based electrostrictive materials with excellent properties, such as Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3 (PMN), Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-PbTiO3 (PMN-PT) and Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-PbTiO3-Bi(Zn2/3Nb1/3)O3 (PMN-PT-BZN). This makes lead-free electrostrictive materials more interesting , including BaTiO3(BT)-based, Bi1/2Na1/2TiO3 (BNT)-based, and K1/2Na1/2NbO3 (KNN)-based materials. Zhang et al. first reported the discovery of large electrostriction in BNT-based ceramics. By adding KNN to BNT-BT-based ceramics to induce the antiferroelectric phase, a large electrostrictive strain (S = 0.14 %) and a good electrostrictive effect (Q = 0.027 mE^{4}/CE^{2}) were obtained at room temperature , which is similar to that of PMN single crystals. After abundant research, the BNT-based relaxor ferroelectric system is regarded as an important potential system of lead-free electrostriction. Current studies on electrostrictive BNT-based materials are mostly focused on ceramics and single-crystal materials. The understanding of the electrostrictive property of BNT-based thin films, particularly those grown on silicon substrates for integrated actuator applications, is still quite lacking. One of the few results reported on the electrostriction in BNT-based thin films was done at a microscopic scale, Q=0.025 mE^{4}/CE^{2} (Strain of 0.26 %) was calculated from the displacement measured by piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) for BNT\u2013BKT100x thin film. The macroscopic electrostrictive effect of BNT-based thin films, which is more important for device applications, was rarely reported. It is worth noting here that the composition of BNT-based materials strongly impacts their relaxor property and, subsequently, the electrostrictive effect. In general, it is believed that BNT-based materials with ergodic relaxor properties favor obtaining a pure electrostrictive strain at room temperature, which makes it easy for us to calculate the electrostriction coefficient. A ternary solid solution, (0.8-x)Bi1/2Na1/2TiO3-0.2SrTiO3-xBaTiO3 (BNT-ST-BT) ceramics, was reported strong relaxor behavior arose by varying the BT content. By introducing BT into the BNT-ST systems, the strain response increased, and the polarization decreased , which is potential for high electrostriction coefficient (Q) according to. In this work, (0.8-x)Bi1/2Na1/2TiO3-0.2SrTiO3-xBaTiO3 (BNT-ST-100xBT, x = 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.11) thin films on Pt/TiO2/SiO2/Si substrates were prepared by a sol-gel method. The electrical properties, including dielectric properties as a function of frequency, DC electric field, and temperature, ferroelectric hysteresis loops, and strain response curves, were investigated in detail. By introducing BT into the BNT-20ST, a large electrostrain and giant electrostrictive coefficient were obtained in the thin films.

# CONCLUSION
In conclusion, BNT-ST-100xBT (x = 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.11) thin films have been successfully prepared using the CSD method and systematically investigated. The thin films on (111) Pt/TiO2/SiO2/Si substrates displayed a pseudocubic structure and fine grains with a size of tens of nanometers. The BNT-ST-BT thin films with various BT content displayed super electrostrictive effects with a Q value larger than 0.1 mE^{4}/CE^{2}. The Q value varied with the composition, and a giant electrostrictive coefficient of 0.21 mE^{4}/CE^{2} was obtained in the x = 0.06 composition with pure electrostrictive behavior and low hysteresis. This work makes an important step forward in seeking large electrostrictive coefficients in BNT-based thin films. The linear increase of strain under a high electric field in BNT-ST-6BT thin film promotes the film application in micro-actuators.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
shows the XRD 2\u03b8 patterns ranging from 20\xb0 to 65\xb0 of BNT-ST-100xBT lead-free piezoelectric thin films. It can be seen in (a) that four peaks appear at 2\u03b8 = 22.8\xb0, 32.5\xb0, 46.6\xb0, and 57.9\xb0, corresponding to the (001), (110), (002), and (112) reflections of the BNT-ST-100xBT films respectively. The diffraction peak of Pt (111) was detected at 39.9\xb0. There no second-phase peaks were detected by XRD, indicating that BT had completely dissolved in the BNT-20ST crystal matrix, forming a uniform and stable solid solution with a single perovskite structure. The XRD patterns confirm the polycrystalline structure in all thin films without any preferred orientation. Analysis of the (111) and (002) peaks is a useful method to distinguish the tetragonal and rhombohedral phases in BNT-based materials. In order to better understand the symmetry structure of BNT-ST-100xBT, the XRD slow scan results of the thin films at 2\u03b8 = 45.7\xb0 - 47.4\xb0 were plotted in (b). Prado et al. , the amplified (002) peaks of all the thin films were fitted well using a single peak without obvious splitting characteristics, indicating that the thin films have a pseudocubic structure. It was reported that a pseudocubic structure existed in BNT-ST-BT ceramics with low BT content, while when the BT content increased by more than 8 %, a tetragonal structure arose. However, in our BNT-ST-BT thin film with BT ranging from 2 % to 11 %, pseudocubic dominant. It is commonly observed in BNT-based thin films as an approach-cubic structure due to the tiny lattice distortion of BNT-based material and small grains of thin films. In addition, with the increase of BT content, the BaE^{2+}(r=1.35 \xc5) enters the BNT-ST lattice and replaces the original NaE^{+} (r = 0.95 \xc5), BiE^{3+} (r = 1.08 \xc5) and SrE^{2+} (r = 1.13 \xc5) at A site. The larger ionic radius of BaE^{2+} expands the crystal lattice of the film, causing the XRD peaks to shift to lower 2\u03b8 values. The surface morphologies of BNT-ST-100xBT (x = 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.11) thin films were shown in (a-e), and the related corresponding grain size count were exhibited in (f). The particles of all films were uniform, with a statistical distribution size below 70 nm, and varied little in the film composition. (g-k) shows the cross-sectional morphologies of BNT-ST-100xBT films with Pt/TiO2/SiO2/Si structure. The thickness of thin films was determined from the images in the range of 0.69\u20130.76 \u03bcm. One is the Scherrer equation based on XRD patterns , and another is dimensioning from the SEM images. Except for a discrepancy in BNT-ST-11BT thin film, the mean grain sizes were around 40 nm for the films. depicts the dielectric constant and loss versus temperature for the BNT-ST-100xBT (x = 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.11) thin films from 25\xb0C to 200\xb0C at various frequencies of 1 kHz, 10 kHz and 100 kHz. As shown in (a)-(e), the dielectric constants of all films exhibited similar behavior as a function of the temperature, i.e., firstly increased and then decreased, while at the same temperature, the dielectric constant (\u03b5r) decreased when increasing the frequency. At room temperature, BNT-ST-6BT thin films represented the largest value among all films at each frequency, demonstrating their good polarization property. All films showed rather low dielectric loss (<0.04), which is related to the high quality and dense structure of the film prepared in this work. One dielectric anomaly appeared at the temperature of T m, at which the maximum permittivity (\u03b5m) was observed in all the thin films. In the thin films with x = 0.02\u20130.08, as the BT content increased, the dielectric peak moved toward lower temperatures. To further explore the relaxation properties of the films, the relaxation degree was calculated through the modified Curie-Weiss law : Where \u03b5 r is the relative dielectric permittivity at the temperature T (T > T m ), and C is the Curie-like constant. The coefficient \u03b3 reflects the ferroelectricity degree or relaxation degree of the material, for which close to 1 means ideal normal ferroelectricity, and close to 2 indicates that the material has classic relaxation properties. The BNT-ST-2BT thin film with a lower \u03b3 value is due to the coexistence of ferroelectric and relaxor state, while the thin films with BT content of more than 4 % with \u03b3 value close to 2 demonstrate an approach-ergodic relaxor characteristic. (a-j) exhibits the curves of the dielectric constant and dielectric loss of the BNT-ST-100xBT (x = 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.11) thin films as a function of DC electric field from \u2212300 kV\xb7cmE^{\u22121} to 300 kV\xb7cmE^{\u22121} (\u03b5 r-E curves) at room temperature. The \u03b5 r-E curves of BNT-ST-2BT thin film presented a "butterfly" shape with obvious hysteresis, while, when the BT content increased, a \u201cdouble butterfly\u201d shape appeared, and the feature became more apparent. The dielectric loss vs. electric field curves exhibited a \u201cdouble butterfly\u201d shape in all films, and the feature became more apparent with BT content increasing. The dielectric constant and loss curves of BNT-ST-2BT thin films in (a) and (f) show two broadened \u03b5 peaks and four loss peaks. The characteristics are similar to those reported in BNT-based materials around depoling temperature , where nonergodic and ergodic relaxation states coexist. For BNT-ST-100xBT (x = 0.04\u20130.11) thin films in (b-e) and (g-j), four peaks in the dielectric constant and loss curves appeared due to the branches on the decreasing field, which is the feature of BNT-based materials at a temperature higher than depoling temperature with ergodic relaxor state. The ferroelectric properties of BNT-ST-100xBT (x = 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.11) thin films were characterized, and the P-E loos, maximum polarization (P max), remanent polarization (P r), P max-P r and coercive field (E c) values at a maximum applied electric field (E max) of 600 kV/cm were displayed in (a, b). With the increase of BT content, the ordered ferroelectric domain was destroyed, while the P max and P r showed a decreasing trend. The BNT-ST-2BT thin film exhibited the strongest ferroelectricity, with the P max and P r larger than the other four films, indicating that more ferroelectric domains along the polarization field are maintained after the electric field is removed in the film. The minimum \u03b3 in  for BNT-ST-2BT thin film conforms with the strongest ferroelectricity related to domain motion. The thin films with x = 0.04 \u223c 0.11 exhibited low-hysteresis P-E loops with a slim shape, low P r, and high E c, related to the relaxor ferroelectric feature with ergodic polar nanoregions (PNRs). The redirect of the PNRs when an electric field is applied contributes to the generation of polarization. The weakly correlated ergodic PNRs return to the disordered state upon the removal of the applied field, thus giving rise to the near-zero remanent polarization. The P max and P r of other components (x = 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, and 0.11) were not much different, but relatively large P max and P r can still be observed at x = 0.06, which is closely related to the maximum dielectric constant shown in (c). Moreover, the composition x = 0.06 exhibited a low E c , demonstrating the dominative of ergodic relaxor phase, which is in favor of hysteresis-free electrostrain. (c-g) describes the polarization loops of BNT-ST-100xBT thin films under different E max. Bipolar strain curves were obtained by applying 600 kV/cm for the BNT-ST-100xBT (x = 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.11) thin films. The fitting of the strain curve at x = 0.11 with a parabolic function was shown in (a) as an example. Based on the data of the S-E loops in (a) and the corresponding P-E loops at an E max of 600 kV/cm in (a), the S-P E^{2} curves were calculated and shown in (b). The strain to the square of the polarization for the film at x = 0.02 deviated slightly from linearity, which is related to its strongest ferroelectricity. Films of other components (x = 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, and 0.11) all showed a highly linear relationship of S-P E^{2} curves, indicating pure electrostrictive behavior with short-range ordered polarization. The electrostrictive coefficients Q were calculated from the S-P E^{2} curves according to formula (1) and shown in. BNT-ST-6BT thin films have achieved the largest electrostrictive coefficient, 0.21 mE^{4}/CE^{2}, which is an order of magnitude higher than that obtained in ceramics. The unipolar strain of BNT-ST-100xBT (x = 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.11) thin films at an E max of 600 kV/cm and 1800 kV/cm were shown in (c). The unipolar strain curves measured at 600 kV/cm exhibited a parabolic shape behavior, which is similar to that of bipolar strain curves. With the increase of the applied electric field from 600 kV/cm to 1800 kV/cm, the strains increased linearly, which is an advantage for actuating applications. Furthermore, the hysteresis of the unipolar strain curve was small, which indicates a good application potential of BNT-ST-100xBT thin films. By linearly fitting the strain curve under the electric field from 600 kV/cm to 1800 kV/cm in (c), the piezoelectric coefficient d 33 of each component can be obtained, as shown in. The largest d 33 value was obtained in x = 0.02 film. Beyond that, the x = 0.06 films exhibited the biggest d 33 value in the besides components. Furthermore, by changing the E max, a series of unipolar S-E curves of BNT-ST-6BT thin films were acquired and presented in (d). The S-E curves below 600 kV/cm appeared parabolic in shape, while, as the applied electric field increased to 2400 kV/cm, the strain increased linearly until a remarkable strain value of 0.82 % was achieved. To understand the domain and polarization behavior in these relaxor thin films, the BNT-ST-100xBT (x = 0.02, 0.06, 0.11) films were studied by PFM. Clear grain boundaries can be observed in the topography images, with the grain size being tens of nanometers, which is in agreement with that calculated from SEM images. The phase images of the three films in (d-f) emerged as a \u201cmosaic-like\u201d form, meaning no domain feature can be determined from the phase images. The blue circled region in (h) of BNT-ST-2BT thin films appeared to have a distinct amplitude response in nm-sized, which would be likely related to nanodomains. The remaining region without amplitude signal may be related to PNRs, which are below the resolution of PFM measurements (tens of nanometers, depending on the tip and measurement parameters), appearing as noise form. No mesoscopic domain feature can be observed for BNT-ST-100xBT (x = 0.06, 0.11) films in (i, j), which could be in PNRs form. The domain characterization of these films was in the size of tens of nanometers or in PNRs, which was related to their relaxor behavior increasing with BT content. The BNT-ST-BT thin films in this work exhibit outstanding electrostrictive coefficients. Furthermore, the BNT-ST-6BT thin films can take both sides of high giant electrostrictive coefficients and excellent electrostrain properties. The binary BNT-ST solid solution is regarded as a potential base for high strain performance, with composition located on the ferroelectric and relaxor phase boundary with an ST content of 20\u223c25 %. By introducing BT into the binary solid solution to form ternary materials, the polarization decreased with increasing BT content. When the BT content increased higher than 2 %, the P-E loops became slim, and diffusion coefficient \u03b3 was close to 2, which are characteristics of a relaxor material. In this work, as expected, except for the BNT-ST-2BT thin film, the compositions, including x from 0.04 to 0.11, exhibited a predominant relaxor behavior with \u03b3 approaching 2. The polarization distribution of these ergodic relaxor thin films is in the form of nanodomains/PNRs, as shown in (b). As a result, giant Q values were obtained in the BNT-ST-100xBT (x = 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.11) thin films, largely higher than the results reported. Compared to the above composition, the lower electrostrictive coefficient in x = 0.02 is due to its lower relaxor degree, which, in turn, is beneficial to the highest piezoelectric coefficient in this film. The low dielectric constant, lower than 200 at 1 kHz in the BNT-ST-BT thin films, is beneficial in reaching a large electrostrictive coefficient. In addition, the largest Q was obtained in BNT-ST-6BT thin films, higher than the other components in the deep ergodic relaxation zone. It was reported in BNT-based materials that the BT content played an effective role in regular polarization and piezoelectric properties. The phase boundary of a ferroelectric/relaxor or nonergodic/ergodic relaxor can be constructed by varying the BT content. The phase diagram of BNT-ST-100xBT ceramics has reported that the pseudocubic and tetragonal phases coexist in the x range of 0.04\u20130.06, in which the composition of a large electrostrain can be obtained by constructing ferroelectrics with ergodic relaxation characteristics. In our BNT-ST-100xBT thin films, a single pseudocubic phase was observed in the films with BT content ranging from 2 % to 11 %. The absence of obvious phase transition in these films from XRD analysis is likely due to the small lattice distortion in this system, a phenomenon which was reported in the BNT-BT-NN ternary solid solutions. An evident performance variation with BT content were pronounced that, which is in BNT-ST-6BT thin films, the largest dielectric constant, the largest polarization variability, the highest piezoelectric coefficient, and the largest strain response were obtained. It is believed the BaE^{2+} diffused into the BNT-ST lattice, increasing the A-site disorder and resulting in a phase disorder transition in microscale at the BNT-ST-6BT compositions. The largest Q obtained in BNT-ST-6BT thin films is due to the largest strain response and low polarization according to formula (1).

# TITLE
Simultaneous giant strain and electrostrictive coefficient in lead-free BNT-ST-BT ergodic relaxor thin films on Pt/TiO<inf>2</inf>/SiO<inf>2</inf>/Si substrates

# ABSTRACT
Lead-free ferroelectric compound Bi1/2Na1/2TiO3 has great potential in realizing large electrostrain response and electrostrictive coefficient. In this work, (0.8-x)Bi1/2Na1/2TiO3-0.2SrTiO3-xBaTiO3 (BNT-ST-100xBT) thin films were prepared by chemical solution deposition method. The most significant electrostrictive effect was obtained in the ergodic relaxor BNT-ST-6BT thin film, i.e., a giant electrostrictive coefficient of 0.21 m4/C2. Meanwhile, by increasing the applied electric field, a linearly increasing strain and the maximum value of 0.82 % were obtained in this film.

# INTRODUCTION
Future Internet of Things (IoT) society requires various integrated micro-electro-mechanical-systems (MEMS) devices like sensors and actuators. As an important family of functional materials, ferroelectric (FE) materials could be applied to various devices thanks to their multiple functionalities, one of which consists in the electric field-induced strain. In particular, the advantages of high strain, fast response speed, and large driving force make FE thin films with the perovskite structure ideal for micro-actuator applications. However, the further performance enhancement of perovskite FE thin films-based actuators faces the challenge of the relatively large hysteresis of electrostrain curves in FE films. The electrostrain of FE materials comes from not only the inverse piezoelectric effect but also from the electrostrictive effect, the phase transition, and the domain wall motion. Researchers have recently developed a series of lead-based electrostrictive materials with excellent properties, such as Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3 (PMN), Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-PbTiO3 (PMN-PT) and Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-PbTiO3-Bi(Zn2/3Nb1/3)O3 (PMN-PT-BZN). This makes lead-free electrostrictive materials more interesting , including BaTiO3(BT)-based, Bi1/2Na1/2TiO3 (BNT)-based, and K1/2Na1/2NbO3 (KNN)-based materials. Zhang et al. first reported the discovery of large electrostriction in BNT-based ceramics. By adding KNN to BNT-BT-based ceramics to induce the antiferroelectric phase, a large electrostrictive strain (S = 0.14 %) and a good electrostrictive effect (Q = 0.027 mE^{4}/CE^{2}) were obtained at room temperature , which is similar to that of PMN single crystals. After abundant research, the BNT-based relaxor ferroelectric system is regarded as an important potential system of lead-free electrostriction. Current studies on electrostrictive BNT-based materials are mostly focused on ceramics and single-crystal materials. The understanding of the electrostrictive property of BNT-based thin films, particularly those grown on silicon substrates for integrated actuator applications, is still quite lacking. One of the few results reported on the electrostriction in BNT-based thin films was done at a microscopic scale, Q=0.025 mE^{4}/CE^{2} (Strain of 0.26 %) was calculated from the displacement measured by piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) for BNT\u2013BKT100x thin film. The macroscopic electrostrictive effect of BNT-based thin films, which is more important for device applications, was rarely reported. It is worth noting here that the composition of BNT-based materials strongly impacts their relaxor property and, subsequently, the electrostrictive effect. In general, it is believed that BNT-based materials with ergodic relaxor properties favor obtaining a pure electrostrictive strain at room temperature, which makes it easy for us to calculate the electrostriction coefficient. A ternary solid solution, (0.8-x)Bi1/2Na1/2TiO3-0.2SrTiO3-xBaTiO3 (BNT-ST-BT) ceramics, was reported strong relaxor behavior arose by varying the BT content. By introducing BT into the BNT-ST systems, the strain response increased, and the polarization decreased , which is potential for high electrostriction coefficient (Q) according to. In this work, (0.8-x)Bi1/2Na1/2TiO3-0.2SrTiO3-xBaTiO3 (BNT-ST-100xBT, x = 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.11) thin films on Pt/TiO2/SiO2/Si substrates were prepared by a sol-gel method. The electrical properties, including dielectric properties as a function of frequency, DC electric field, and temperature, ferroelectric hysteresis loops, and strain response curves, were investigated in detail. By introducing BT into the BNT-20ST, a large electrostrain and giant electrostrictive coefficient were obtained in the thin films.

# CONCLUSION
In conclusion, BNT-ST-100xBT (x = 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.11) thin films have been successfully prepared using the CSD method and systematically investigated. The thin films on (111) Pt/TiO2/SiO2/Si substrates displayed a pseudocubic structure and fine grains with a size of tens of nanometers. The BNT-ST-BT thin films with various BT content displayed super electrostrictive effects with a Q value larger than 0.1 mE^{4}/CE^{2}. The Q value varied with the composition, and a giant electrostrictive coefficient of 0.21 mE^{4}/CE^{2} was obtained in the x = 0.06 composition with pure electrostrictive behavior and low hysteresis. This work makes an important step forward in seeking large electrostrictive coefficients in BNT-based thin films. The linear increase of strain under a high electric field in BNT-ST-6BT thin film promotes the film application in micro-actuators.
