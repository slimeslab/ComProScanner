Here, the symbols V0, E0, and B are used to represent the optimal volume, ground state energy, and bulk modulus, respectively. Therefore, it can be deduced that BaBi4Ti4O15 is the finest and most stable chemical out of the prototypes analyzed in this study. The Ca have (4a, 8b), Ti have 8b, Bi have 8b, and O have (4a,8b) occupied Wyckoff positions in the studied structures. The calculated formation energies for the BaBi4Ti4O15 and CaBi4Ti4O15 are \u22122.579 eV/atom and \u22121.928 eV/atom respectively. Additionally, we also calculated the phonon dispersion spectra for both BaBi4Ti4O15 and CaBi4Ti4O15 as shown in. The energy band computations were conducted along the high symmetry Brillouin Zone (BZ) axis for these layered perovskites ABi4Ti4O15 (A = Ba, Ca).

The thermodynamic characteristics of solids are utilized to analyze the performance in many applications under strident conditions, when temperature varies at three different pressures (0, 5 and 10 GPa). The GIBBS2 code employs the quasi-harmonic (QH) Debye theory based on the ab-initio approach to compute thermodynamic (TD) characteristics. Debye-Slater, Bebye-Gruneisen, Debye-Einstein, and QHA are the moduli that have an increasing order accuracy compared to one another. In the QH technique, there is a collection of data points including the values of [V,E(V)] that are used for evaluating the thermodynamic performance of materials. The Debye temperature (\u0398D) refers to the temperature at which a crystal's highest normal vibrational mode occurs.

Scientists' fascination with thermoelectric (TE) materials has grown tremendously in response to the global energy problem. This section presents an analysis of the thermoelectric (TE) properties of ABi4Ti4O15 (A = Ba, Ca)in order to evaluate their suitability for use in TE devices. The thermoelectric properties of the chalcogenide materials ABi4Ti4O15 (A = Ba, Ca) are evaluated by employing the traditional Boltzmann kinetic transport theory and the rigid band approximation. In order to assess the thermoelectric (TE) properties of the compounds described above, it is necessary to utilize fundamental TE characteristics such as thermal conductivity q=-k dT dx, power factor (PF=\u03c3 SE^{2}), electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient S= \u0394V \u0394T, and figure of merit ZT= ST \u03c1\u03baE^{2}. The BoltzTraP package, which is based on semi-classical theory, is utilized to compute the temperature-dependent thermoelectric (TE) characteristics, assuming a relaxation time constant. The spectral characteristics of the TE parameters of ABi4Ti4O15 (A = Ba, Ca) are presented in (a\u2013e), covering a temperature range of 0 to 1000 K. Electrical conductivity (\u03c3) is a measure of a material's capacity to conduct electricity. The spectral characteristics of the \u03c3 for ABi4Ti4O15 (A = Ba, Ca) are presented in (a), covering a temperature range of 0 to 1000 K. It is observed that there are no peaks at the beginning (i.e., \u03c3=0), and then peaks for BaBi4Ti4O15 and CaBi4Ti4O15start to appear at around 500and 550 K, respectively. These temperatures are known as the threshold value of \u03c3. Following the threshold temperature, there is a noticeable exponential rise in the \u03c3 plots as temperature increase. The upward trend observed in the \u03c3 plots provide evidence of the semiconducting properties of ABi4Ti4O15 (A = Ba, Ca). The values of \u03c3 for CaBi4Ti4O15 are higher than those for BaBi4Ti4O15 across the whole temperature range. The maximum conductivity values (\u03c3) for BaBi4Ti4O15 and CaBi4Ti4O15 are \xd7E^{4.81}E^{10}E^{16} and \xd7 \u03a9.m.s -E^{6.03}E^{10}E^{16}E^{1}, respectively. Both lattice vibrations and electrons play an integral part in the amount of heat conductivity (\u03ba) that semiconductors exhibit.The thermal conductivity \u03ba can be determined using Fourier's law. The spectral characteristics of the \u03ba for ABi4Ti4O15 (A = Ba, Ca) are presented in (b), covering a temperature range of 0 to 1000 K. It is observed that there are no peaks at the beginning (i.e., \u03ba=0), and then peaks for BaBi4Ti4O15 and CaBi4Ti4O15 start to appear at around 550 and 600 K, respectively. These temperatures are known as the threshold value of \u03ba. Following the threshold temperature, there is a noticeable exponential rise in the \u03ba plots as temperature increase.The reason for the increase in \u03ba at room temperature is that the wavelength of the phonons is greater than the size of the crystal boundary. All phonon contributions to \u03ba are either equal to or smaller than the crystal boundary. Moreover, the values of \u03ba for CaBi4Ti4O15 are higher than those for BaBi4Ti4O15 across the whole temperature range. The maximum thermal conductivity values (\u03ba) for BaBi4Ti4O15 and CaBi4Ti4O15 are \xd7E^{1.88}E^{10}E^{13} and \xd7 W m.K.sE^{2.14}E^{10}E^{13}, respectively. An electric potential difference (\u0394V) is generated as electrons migrate from a region of greater temperature to a region of lower temperature, driven by a temperature gradient made by connecting two different materials. The thermocouple's efficiency can be determined by calculating the Seebeck coefficient, which is the ratio of \u0394V to \u0394T. The spectral characteristics of the S for ABi4Ti4O15 (A = Ba, Ca) are presented in (c), covering a temperature range of 0 to 1000 K. Observing the S plots, it is evident that ABi4Ti4O15 (A = Ba, Ca) exhibit positive S values, indicating that they are p-type semiconductor materials.

Materials are considered to be excellent thermoelectric materials if their S values exceed 200 \u03bcV/K. The thermoelectric materials ABi4Ti4O15 (A = Ba, Ca) exhibit S values that closely align with the stated standard. The spectral characteristics of the PF for ABi4Ti4O15 (A = Ba, Ca) are presented in (d), covering a temperature range of 0 to 1000 K. It is observed that there are no peaks at the beginning (i.e., PF=0), and then peaks for BaBi4Ti4O15 and CaBi4Ti4O15start to appear at around 500and 550 K, respectively. These temperatures are known as the threshold value of PF. Once the threshold temperature is reached, a noticeable exponential rise in PF plots become apparent as temperatures continue to grow. The maximum thermal power factors (PF) for BaBi4Ti4O15 and CaBi4Ti4O15are \xd7E^{2.71}E^{10}E^{10} and \xd7 W m. K.sE^{2.91}E^{10}E^{10}E^{2}, respectively. The spectral characteristics of the ZT for ABi4Ti4O15 (A = Ba, Ca) are presented in (e), covering a temperature range of 0 to 1000 K.ZT plots are utilized to ascertain the thermoelectric efficiency of the materials under investigation. For both materials, the ZT values are initially around 1.0 and subsequently exhibit an exponential increase with increasing temperature. The maximum ZT values forBaBi4Ti4O15 and CaBi4Ti4O15are1.43 and 1.36, respectively. For a thermoelectric material to be suitable for use in thermoelectric devices, it is necessary for the ZT value to be equal to or greater than 1. ABi4Ti4O15 (A = Ba, Ca) exhibits promising potential for applications in thermoelectric (TE) devices due to their ZT values, which remain above 1 across the whole temperature range. Based on the ZT values of ABi4Ti4O15 (A = Ba, Ca), it may be inferred that both compounds are effective thermoelectric material for usage in TE devices.

# INTRODUCTION
PbZr0.52Ti0.48O3 and PbMg1/3Nb2/3O3\u2013PbZr0.52Ti0.48O3 are examples of lead-based perovskite ferroelectric oxides that exhibit significant piezoelectric and electromechanical characteristics at normal room temperature. These materials are extensively utilized in the field of sensors and actuators.Nevertheless, lead is highly poisonous, and the Curie temperature of materials containing lead is typically lower than 400 \xb0C. Due to the necessity of operating in temperatures over 400 \xb0C, there has been a persistent focus on finding lead-free piezoelectric ceramics that may be used in many applications such as fire control and engine systems. The crystal structure of perovskite consists of alternating layers of Am\u22121BmO3m+1 blocks and Bi2O2 layers. The perovskite blocks are made up of m layers of BO6 octahedra, with an A site cation. The Aurivillius-type family, sometimes referred to as bismuth-layered structure ferroelectrics (BLSFs) with a general formula of (Bi2O2)E^{2+} (Am-1BmO3m+1)E^{2\u2212}, have been suggested as highly suitable materials for high-temperature applications. These materials inherently have a high Curie temperature (TC), leading to high temperatures at which the ferro\u2013paraelectric phase transition occurs and exhibiting a thermally stable piezoelectric response. Calcium bismuth titanate, also known as CaBi4Ti4O15 (CBT) with a value of m=4, is an extensively researched material with the property of being a bismuth-layered structured ferroelectric (BLSF). It exhibits orthorhombic symmetry and belongs to the A21am space group at room temperature, as indicated by previous studies.CBT exhibits a high thermal conductivity, however, its layered structure restricts the material's transportation aspects during the sintering process. Additionally, its spontaneous polarization along the a-b plane results in a low piezoelectric coefficient (d33) of around 8 pC/N. As a result, the applications of CBT are limited. In several other studies, the scientists put their efforts to enhance the values of residual polarization (Pr), d33, and TC through modifications in manufacturing procedures or ion doping at A and B sites of CBT. In a recent study, Wu et al. described the production of CaBi4Ti4O15 ceramics doped with Gd and Mn. The researchers obtained a high activation energy value of 1.87 eV for direct current conduction. Xi et al. created a ceramic system of Ca0.85(LiCe)0.075Bi4Ti4\u2212xZnxO15 and documented a d33 value of 20 pC/N, which indicates a high piezoelectric coefficient. Xiao et al. utilized a typical solid-state reaction approach to create a Ca1\u2212x(Li, Ho)x/2Bi4Ti4O15 ceramic system. The resulting ceramic exhibited a high resistivity of \xd7E^{4.51}E^{10}E^{11}\u03a9 cm and an improved TC (Curie temperature) of 814 \xb0C, as reported in their study.Liu et al. fabricated the CaBi4Ti4\u2212x(Nb1/2Fe1/2)xO15 ceramic system, which exhibited a low dielectric loss (tan\u03b4) of 5.9 % at a temperature of 400 \xb0C. Wenzhi Qi et al. have experimentally reported the photocatalytic activity of BaBi4Ti4O15. Shuai Zhao et al. have theoretically determined that the single-layer Aurivillius perovskite Ba2PbI6 has a straight band gap of 1.89 eV, which can be decreased by replacing Pb with Ge and Sn. The anticipated energy gaps for Ba2GeI6 and Ba2SnI6 are 0.85 and 0.82 eV, respectively, as reported in reference. Wei et al. have shown that the photocatalytic activity under visible light may be greatly enhanced by doping the BTO structure with non-metals. Xu et al. employed Density Functional Theory (DFT) in their first-principles calculations to determine the optical, electrical, and ferroelectric characteristics of CaBi2Ta2O9. The findings suggest that there is an indirect band gap of 3.11 eV. While experimental studies have examined the architectures of BBT and CBT crystals , no theoretical examination has been undertaken to date, as far as we know. For ammonia detection at room temperature, highly recoverable, and stable, nitrogen-doped Ti3C2Tx-based sensors are developed.

The electronic configuration of the valence electrons in Ba, Ca, Ti, Bi, and O are to [Xe] sE^{6}E^{2}, [Ar] sE^{4}E^{2}, [Ar] d sE^{3}E^{2}E^{4}E^{2}, [Xe] f d s pE^{4}E^{14}E^{5}E^{10}E^{6}E^{2}E^{6}E^{3} and [He] s pE^{2}E^{2}E^{2}E^{4}, respectively.The obtained E-V curves during structural optimization of the studied layered perovskites ABi4Ti4O15 (A = Ba, Ca) are presented in. Here, the symbols V0, E0, and B are used to represent the optimal volume, ground state energy, and bulk modulus, respectively. Therefore, it can be deduced that BaBi4Ti4O15 is the finest and most stable chemical out of the prototypes analyzed in this study. The Ca have (4a, 8b), Ti have 8b, Bi have 8b, and O have (4a,8b) occupied Wyckoff positions in the studied structures. The calculated formation energies for the BaBi4Ti4O15 and CaBi4Ti4O15 are \u22122.579 eV/atom and \u22121.928 eV/atom respectively. Additionally, we also calculated the phonon dispersion spectra for both BaBi4Ti4O15 and CaBi4Ti4O15 as shown in. The energy band computations were conducted along the high symmetry Brillouin Zone (BZ) axis for these layered perovskites ABi4Ti4O15 (A = Ba, Ca). The energy band spectra for both compounds featuring high symmetry Brillouin Zone (BZ) sites (\u0393 \u2192 H \u2192 N \u2192 \u0393 \u2192 P) are presented in. The ground state valence shell electronic configurations of Ba, Ca, Ti, Bi, and O are to [Xe] sE^{6}E^{2}, [Ar] sE^{4}E^{2}, [Ar] d sE^{3}E^{2}E^{4}E^{2}, [Xe] f d s pE^{4}E^{14}E^{5}E^{10}E^{6}E^{2}E^{6}E^{3} and [He] s pE^{2}E^{2}E^{2}E^{4}, respectively.

The conduction and valence band exhibit significant dispersion in K-space, indicating a high degree of mobility for electron-hole carriers, especially in the vicinity of the CBM and VBM. The Density of States (DOS) investigation of semiconductor materials allows for the determination of the atomic and orbital sources of electronic states within its band structure. The DOS are estimated to provide further elucidation on the electronic characteristics of materials. The total density of states (TDOS) for the layered perovskite materials ABi4Ti4O15 (A = Ba, Ca) were estimated using the using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) plus the Hubbard U (GGA + U) approach. The calculation of the partial density of states (PDOS) is used to elucidate the distinct contributions of the atomic orbitals in band structures. The TDOS spectra for both compounds for both spin channels are presented in. Overall, the TDOS spectra for ABi4Ti4O15 (A = Ba, Ca)in both spin channels show similar profile indicating the absence of magnetic moment in the studied layered perovskites. The calculated waveforms of the TDOS for each molecule compound can provide information about the abundance of energy levels at certain energy. The spectral characteristics of the PDOS of BaBi4Ti4O15are presented in , covering an energy range of \u22126.0 to 6.0 eV. The valence band of BaBi4Ti4O15 is mostly influenced by the O-atoms, however there is some minor assistance from the Bi- and Ti-atoms as well. The major contributions of O[pE^{2}E^{4}] and Ba[pE^{5}E^{6}] electrons to the valence band in the PDOS is clearly demonstrated in. Nevertheless, there are also minor contributions from the Ti[dE^{3}E^{2}], Bi[pE^{6}E^{3}], and Bi[sE^{6}E^{2}]electrons. The conduction band mostly arises from the interaction between the Ti- and Bi-atoms of BaTi4Bi4O15. Based on the \u2032s PDOS, the Bi[pE^{6}E^{3}]and Ti[dE^{3}E^{2}] electrons make notable contributions to the conduction band. Nevertheless, there are also minor contributions from the O[pE^{2}E^{4}]electrons. The valence band in the vicinity of the Fermi level exhibits a high density of bands, which is a result of the hybridization of sub-energy levels from O[pE^{2}E^{4}] and Ba[pE^{5}E^{6}]. The spectral characteristics of the PDOS of CaBi4Ti4O15 are presented in , covering an energy range of \u22126.0 to 6.0 eV. The valence band of CaBi4Ti4O15is mostly influenced by the O-atoms, however there is some minor assistance from the Bi- and Ti-atoms as well. The major contributions of O[pE^{2}E^{4}], Ca[sE^{4}E^{2}], and Ca[pE^{3}E^{6}] electrons to the valence band in the PDOS is clearly demonstrated in. Nevertheless, there are also minor contributions from the Ti[dE^{3}E^{2}], Bi[pE^{6}E^{3}], and Bi[sE^{6}E^{2}]electrons. The conduction band mostly arises from the interaction between the Ti- and Bi-atoms of CaTi4Bi4O15. Based on the \u2032s PDOS, the Bi[pE^{6}E^{3}]and Ti[dE^{3}E^{2}] electrons make notable contributions to the conduction band. Nevertheless, there are also minor contributions from the O[pE^{2}E^{4}]and Ca[sE^{4}E^{2}]electrons. The valence band in the vicinity of the Fermi level exhibits a high density of bands, which is a result of the hybridization of sub-energy levels from O[pE^{2}E^{4}] and Ca[pE^{3}E^{6}]. The optical characteristics are examined using the complex dielectric function \u03b5(\u03c9), which is dependent on frequency and given in Eq.. Here, \u03b51 (\u03c9) represents the real part and \u03b52 (\u03c9) represents the imaginary part of the complex dielectric function. The refractive index n(\u03c9), normal incident reflectivity R(\u03c9), real optical conductivity \u03c3(\u03c9), energy loss function L(\u03c9) andoptical absorption coefficient \u03b1(\u03c9) of semiconducting materials can be determined by calculating the real and imaginary parts of the complex dielectric function.

The highest peaks in the spectra of \u03b52 (\u03c9) for BaBi4Ti4O15 and CaBi4Ti4O15 correspond to the energies around 4.78 and 4.92 eV, respectively. These peaks are a result of the response to K-states, with a significant contribution from the flat dispersion of the VBM and CBM away from the \u0393-point. The variables in the equation are defined as follows: m represents mass, e represents electron charge, \u03c9 represents frequency, P represents the momentum operator,\u210f\u03c9 represents the energy of the incident phonon, |kn\u2032\u3009 denotes the crystal wave function, and f kn\u2032 represents the Fermi distribution.The phenomenon of incident photon dispersion by the host materials can be described using \u03b51 (\u03c9). The computation of the real component of the dielectric function \u03b51 (\u03c9), given in Equation , is performed using Kramers Kronig relations (KKR), also known as the dispersive part of dielectric function. The spectral characteristics of the \u03b51 (\u03c9) of ABi4Ti4O15 (A = Ba, Ca) are presented in , covering an energy range of 0 to 14 eV. The static values of the complex dielectric function \u03b51 (\u03c9) correspond to the finite values of \u03b51 (0) when the energy is zero (\u03c9=0), also known as zero frequency limit. Penn model states that energy band gap (Eg) and \u03b51 (0) are in inverse relation with each other as specified by Equation. The computed values of static dielectric functions for ABi4Ti4O15 (A = Ba, Ca) are indicated in. The Plasmon frequency refers to the intersection point of the spectral curves of \u03b51 (\u03c9) with the zero axis.The Plasmon frequencies for BaBi4Ti4O15 and CaBi4Ti4O15 correspond to the energies around 6.22 and 6.24 eV, respectively. The refractive index n(\u03c9) is an essential measurement for assessing the appropriateness of an optical material for its technical applications in detectors, photonic crystals, solar cells, and waveguides. The refractive index n(\u03c9) corresponds to the \u03b51 (\u03c9) and provides information about the dispersion of photons. The refractive index n(\u03c9) is determined by employing calculated values of \u03b51 (\u03c9) and \u03b52 (\u03c9) using the relation provided below in Eq. :  The spectral characteristics of the n(\u03c9) of ABi4Ti4O15 (A = Ba, Ca) are presented in , covering an energy range of 0 to 14 eV.

The highest peaks in the spectra of K(\u03c9) for BaBi4Ti4O15 and CaBi4Ti4O15 correspond to the energies around 6.72 and 6.86 eV, respectively. These peaks are a result of the response to K-states, with a significant contribution from the flat dispersion of the VBM and CBM away from the \u0393-point. The extinction coefficient K(\u03c9) is determined by employing calculated values of \u03b51 (\u03c9) and \u03b52 (\u03c9) using the relations provided below in Eq. :  The extinction coefficient K(\u03c9) corresponds to the \u03b52 (\u03c9) and provides information about the absorption of photons. The extinction coefficient K(\u03c9) is commonly referred to as the primary absorption edge. This term signifies the existence of threshold energy at 2.12 eV for BaBi4Ti4O15 and 2.36 eV for CaBi4Ti4O15.These layered perovskites exhibit strong photon absorption in the near UV spectrum, making them extremely appealing for utilization in photovoltaic applications like solar cells. The energy loss function L(\u03c9) can be utilized to accurately determine the energy dissipation of the electrons in the material. The electrons are coerced into undergoing collective oscillations, which is the underlying reason for this Plasmon dissipation.The spectral characteristics of the L(\u03c9) of ABi4Ti4O15 (A = Ba, Ca) are presented in , covering an energy range of 0 to 14 eV. illustrates a prominent L(\u03c9) peak in the deep UV region.

The computed values of static reflectivity for ABi4Ti4O15 (A = Ba, Ca) are indicated in. The spectral peaks exhibited a gradual increase followed by a subsequent decline, eventually going to their lowest values. reveals that the spectra of R(\u03c9) demonstrate reflection of approximately 35 % of photons throughout the entire range of energy.

The thermodynamic characteristics of solids are utilized to analyze the performance in many applications under strident conditions, when temperature varies at three different pressures (0, 5 and 10 GPa). The GIBBS2 code employs the quasi-harmonic (QH) Debye theory based on the ab-initio approach to compute thermodynamic (TD) characteristics. Debye-Slater, Bebye-Gruneisen, Debye-Einstein, and QHA are the moduli that have an increasing order accuracy compared to one another. In the QH technique, there is a collection of data points including the values of [V,E(V)] that are used for evaluating the thermodynamic performance of materials. The Debye temperature (\u0398D) refers to the temperature at which a crystal's highest normal vibrational mode occurs. This TD parameter can provide an effective interpretation of the effects of temperature on crystal characteristics and heat capacity behavior. Regarding the computations of the Debye temperature (\u0398D), the isotropic approximation serves as the foundation in this work. The \u0398D is determined by employing the relation provided below:  In this context, r, V and M represent the number of atoms per formula unit, the volume, and the molar mass, respectively.

A thermal parameter associated with a change in volume on a crystal lattice is the Gr\xfcneisen parameter (\u03b3).The Gr\xfcneisen parameter (\u03b3) is a crucial thermodynamic number that establishes an association between many material characteristics, including volume, heat capacity at constant volume, bulk modulus, and thermal expansion coefficient. We employed a recently designed thermodynamic model that incorporates temperature-dependent potential energy to examine the temperature dependency of the Gr\xfcneisen parameter (\u03b3) for bulk materials. The Gr\xfcneisen parameter (\u03b3) describes the relationship between temperature changes and their effects on the crystal's dynamics or size, ultimately impacting the material's vibrational properties. The spectral characteristics of the \u03b3 for ABi4Ti4O15 (A = Ba, Ca) are presented in at three discrete pressures, covering a continuous temperature range. The system's anharmonic behavior can be elucidated by employing the anticipated values of the \u03b3.

The spectra given for CV demonstrate that both compounds exhibit the TE^{3} law (at high temperatures) and the Dulong-Petit law (at low temperatures), which are standard manifestations of CV behavior. The thermal expansion coefficient (\u03b1) is a measure of the material's tendency to change its volume, area, and shape in response to variations in pressure and temperature.

Scientists' fascination with thermoelectric (TE) materials has grown tremendously in response to the global energy problem. This section presents an analysis of the thermoelectric (TE) properties of ABi4Ti4O15 (A = Ba, Ca)in order to evaluate their suitability for use in TE devices. The thermoelectric properties of the chalcogenide materials ABi4Ti4O15 (A = Ba, Ca) are evaluated by employing the traditional Boltzmann kinetic transport theory and the rigid band approximation. In order to assess the thermoelectric (TE) properties of the compounds described above, it is necessary to utilize fundamental TE characteristics such as thermal conductivity q=-k dT dx, power factor (PF=\u03c3 SE^{2}), electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient S= \u0394V \u0394T, and figure of merit ZT= ST \u03c1\u03baE^{2}. The BoltzTraP package, which is based on semi-classical theory, is utilized to compute the temperature-dependent thermoelectric (TE) characteristics, assuming a relaxation time constant. The spectral characteristics of the TE parameters of ABi4Ti4O15 (A = Ba, Ca) are presented in (a\u2013e), covering a temperature range of 0 to 1000 K. Electrical conductivity (\u03c3) is a measure of a material's capacity to conduct electricity. The spectral characteristics of the \u03c3 for ABi4Ti4O15 (A = Ba, Ca) are presented in (a), covering a temperature range of 0 to 1000 K. It is observed that there are no peaks at the beginning (i.e., \u03c3=0), and then peaks for BaBi4Ti4O15 and CaBi4Ti4O15start to appear at around 500and 550 K, respectively. These temperatures are known as the threshold value of \u03c3. Following the threshold temperature, there is a noticeable exponential rise in the \u03c3 plots as temperature increase. The upward trend observed in the \u03c3 plots provide evidence of the semiconducting properties of ABi4Ti4O15 (A = Ba, Ca). The values of \u03c3 for CaBi4Ti4O15 are higher than those for BaBi4Ti4O15 across the whole temperature range. The maximum conductivity values (\u03c3) for BaBi4Ti4O15 and CaBi4Ti4O15 are \xd7E^{4.81}E^{10}E^{16} and \xd7 \u03a9.m.s -E^{6.03}E^{10}E^{16}E^{1}, respectively. Both lattice vibrations and electrons play an integral part in the amount of heat conductivity (\u03ba) that semiconductors exhibit.The thermal conductivity \u03ba can be determined using Fourier's law. The spectral characteristics of the \u03ba for ABi4Ti4O15 (A = Ba, Ca) are presented in (b), covering a temperature range of 0 to 1000 K. It is observed that there are no peaks at the beginning (i.e., \u03ba=0), and then peaks for BaBi4Ti4O15 and CaBi4Ti4O15 start to appear at around 550 and 600 K, respectively. These temperatures are known as the threshold value of \u03ba. Following the threshold temperature, there is a noticeable exponential rise in the \u03ba plots as temperature increase.The reason for the increase in \u03ba at room temperature is that the wavelength of the phonons is greater than the size of the crystal boundary. All phonon contributions to \u03ba are either equal to or smaller than the crystal boundary. Moreover, the values of \u03ba for CaBi4Ti4O15 are higher than those for BaBi4Ti4O15 across the whole temperature range. The maximum thermal conductivity values (\u03ba) for BaBi4Ti4O15 and CaBi4Ti4O15 are \xd7E^{1.88}E^{10}E^{13} and \xd7 W m.K.sE^{2.14}E^{10}E^{13}, respectively. An electric potential difference (\u0394V) is generated as electrons migrate from a region of greater temperature to a region of lower temperature, driven by a temperature gradient made by connecting two different materials. The thermocouple's efficiency can be determined by calculating the Seebeck coefficient, which is the ratio of \u0394V to \u0394T. The spectral characteristics of the S for ABi4Ti4O15 (A = Ba, Ca) are presented in (c), covering a temperature range of 0 to 1000 K. Observing the S plots, it is evident that ABi4Ti4O15 (A = Ba, Ca) exhibit positive S values, indicating that they are p-type semiconductor materials. The maximum S values for BaBi4Ti4O15 and CaBi4Ti4O15 are \xd7 -E^{2.18}E^{10}E^{3} and \xd7 - V/KE^{2.79}E^{10}E^{3}, respectively. Materials are considered to be excellent thermoelectric materials if their S values exceed 200 \u03bcV/K. The thermoelectric materials ABi4Ti4O15 (A = Ba, Ca) exhibit S values that closely align with the stated standard. The spectral characteristics of the PF for ABi4Ti4O15 (A = Ba, Ca) are presented in (d), covering a temperature range of 0 to 1000 K. It is observed that there are no peaks at the beginning (i.e., PF=0), and then peaks for BaBi4Ti4O15 and CaBi4Ti4O15start to appear at around 500and 550 K, respectively. These temperatures are known as the threshold value of PF. Once the threshold temperature is reached, a noticeable exponential rise in PF plots become apparent as temperatures continue to grow. The maximum thermal power factors (PF) for BaBi4Ti4O15 and CaBi4Ti4O15are \xd7E^{2.71}E^{10}E^{10} and \xd7 W m. K.sE^{2.91}E^{10}E^{10}E^{2}, respectively. The spectral characteristics of the ZT for ABi4Ti4O15 (A = Ba, Ca) are presented in (e), covering a temperature range of 0 to 1000 K.ZT plots are utilized to ascertain the thermoelectric efficiency of the materials under investigation. For both materials, the ZT values are initially around 1.0 and subsequently exhibit an exponential increase with increasing temperature. The maximum ZT values forBaBi4Ti4O15 and CaBi4Ti4O15are1.43 and 1.36, respectively. For a thermoelectric material to be suitable for use in thermoelectric devices, it is necessary for the ZT value to be equal to or greater than 1. ABi4Ti4O15 (A = Ba, Ca) exhibits promising potential for applications in thermoelectric (TE) devices due to their ZT values, which remain above 1 across the whole temperature range. Based on the ZT values of ABi4Ti4O15 (A = Ba, Ca), it may be inferred that both compounds are effective thermoelectric material for usage in TE devices.

# INTRODUCTION
PbZr0.52Ti0.48O3 and PbMg1/3Nb2/3O3\u2013PbZr0.52Ti0.48O3 are examples of lead-based perovskite ferroelectric oxides that exhibit significant piezoelectric and electromechanical characteristics at normal room temperature. These materials are extensively utilized in the field of sensors and actuators.Nevertheless, lead is highly poisonous, and the Curie temperature of materials containing lead is typically lower than 400 \xb0C. Due to the necessity of operating in temperatures over 400 \xb0C, there has been a persistent focus on finding lead-free piezoelectric ceramics that may be used in many applications such as fire control and engine systems. The crystal structure of perovskite consists of alternating layers of Am\u22121BmO3m+1 blocks and Bi2O2 layers. The perovskite blocks are made up of m layers of BO6 octahedra, with an A site cation. The Aurivillius-type family, sometimes referred to as bismuth-layered structure ferroelectrics (BLSFs) with a general formula of (Bi2O2)E^{2+} (Am-1BmO3m+1)E^{2\u2212}, have been suggested as highly suitable materials for high-temperature applications. These materials inherently have a high Curie temperature (TC), leading to high temperatures at which the ferro\u2013paraelectric phase transition occurs and exhibiting a thermally stable piezoelectric response. Calcium bismuth titanate, also known as CaBi4Ti4O15 (CBT) with a value of m=4, is an extensively researched material with the property of being a bismuth-layered structured ferroelectric (BLSF). It exhibits orthorhombic symmetry and belongs to the A21am space group at room temperature, as indicated by previous studies.CBT exhibits a high thermal conductivity, however, its layered structure restricts the material's transportation aspects during the sintering process. Additionally, its spontaneous polarization along the a-b plane results in a low piezoelectric coefficient (d33) of around 8 pC/N. As a result, the applications of CBT are limited. In several other studies, the scientists put their efforts to enhance the values of residual polarization (Pr), d33, and TC through modifications in manufacturing procedures or ion doping at A and B sites of CBT. In a recent study, Wu et al. described the production of CaBi4Ti4O15 ceramics doped with Gd and Mn. The researchers obtained a high activation energy value of 1.87 eV for direct current conduction. Xi et al. created a ceramic system of Ca0.85(LiCe)0.075Bi4Ti4\u2212xZnxO15 and documented a d33 value of 20 pC/N, which indicates a high piezoelectric coefficient. Xiao et al. utilized a typical solid-state reaction approach to create a Ca1\u2212x(Li, Ho)x/2Bi4Ti4O15 ceramic system. The resulting ceramic exhibited a high resistivity of \xd7E^{4.51}E^{10}E^{11}\u03a9 cm and an improved TC (Curie temperature) of 814 \xb0C, as reported in their study.Liu et al. fabricated the CaBi4Ti4\u2212x(Nb1/2Fe1/2)xO15 ceramic system, which exhibited a low dielectric loss (tan\u03b4) of 5.9 % at a temperature of 400 \xb0C. Wenzhi Qi et al. have experimentally reported the photocatalytic activity of BaBi4Ti4O15. Shuai Zhao et al. have theoretically determined that the single-layer Aurivillius perovskite Ba2PbI6 has a straight band gap of 1.89 eV, which can be decreased by replacing Pb with Ge and Sn. The anticipated energy gaps for Ba2GeI6 and Ba2SnI6 are 0.85 and 0.82 eV, respectively, as reported in reference. Wei et al. have shown that the photocatalytic activity under visible light may be greatly enhanced by doping the BTO structure with non-metals. Xu et al. employed Density Functional Theory (DFT) in their first-principles calculations to determine the optical, electrical, and ferroelectric characteristics of CaBi2Ta2O9. The findings suggest that there is an indirect band gap of 3.11 eV. While experimental studies have examined the architectures of BBT and CBT crystals , no theoretical examination has been undertaken to date, as far as we know. For ammonia detection at room temperature, highly recoverable, and stable, nitrogen-doped Ti3C2Tx-based sensors are developed.
