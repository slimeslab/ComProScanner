# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
(a-e) show the fresh cross-section SEM images of the sintered P(ZN) x (HT)1-x ceramics. The grain size distribution of the samples was obtained after counting the size of more than 100 grains, and the statistical results are shown as illustrations in the SEM images of each sample. The average grain size of each P(ZN) x (HT)1-x ceramic sample is plotted in (f). When the PZN content (x) does not exceed 0.100, the average grain size is in the range of 2.26 \u223c 2.55\u03bcm, indicating that a small amount of PZN has little effect on the grain size. When the PZN content (x) exceeds 0.100, the average grain size decreases to 1.69 \u03bcm, which may be related to the further increase of ion complexity at the B site, making the PZN act as a grain growth inhibitor. The XRD partners of the P(ZN) x (HT)1-x ceramics are plotted in (a). With the increase of PZN content (x), the peak shape of (002) and (200) characteristic peaks near 45\xb0 changed obviously ((a)). The \u2160 and \u2162 peaks with more prominent initial peak shape gradually weakened, while the \u2161 peaks in the middle gradually increased ((b)). This means that changing the PZN content (x) can effectively adjust the phase structure of the P(ZN) x (HT)1-x system. For the typical perovskite Pb(Hf,Ti)O3, Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 and BiScO3-PbTiO3 based piezoceramics with multiphase coexistence characteristic, the (002) and (200) characteristic peaks near 45\xb0 can usually be separated into the (002)T and (200)T peaks corresponding to the tetragonal (T) ferroelectric phase and the (200)R peak corresponding to the rhombohedral (R) ferroelectric phase, respectively. Taking the x = 0.100 ceramic sample as an example, the (002)T, (200)R and (200)T peaks fitted by the Lorentz function are shown in (c). Subsequently, the intensity (I) of different fitting peaks was read and the T phase fraction and R phase fraction of the corresponding ceramic samples were calculated according to the T = (I(002)T+I(200)T))/(I(002)T+I(200)R+I(200)T) and R = I(200)R /(I(002)T+I(200)R+I(200)T) formulas. (d) shows the T phase fraction and R phase fraction of the different P(ZN) x (HT)1-x ceramics. With the increase of PZN content (x) with R phase characteristic in the system, the T phase fraction gradually decreases, while the R phase gradually increases. This is consistent with our expectation, that is, the regulation of the R ferroelectric phase of the system provides fertile ground for the formation of MPB and the optimization of the ferroelectric polarization characteristics. The total number of spontaneous polarization directions increases with the increase of PZN content (x), which is consistent with the change trend of R phase fraction ((d-e)). However, when the phase angles (\u03b8 = 85\u201386\xb0) of all the P(ZN) x (HT)1-x ceramic samples are close and tend to be ideal \u03b8\u223c90\xb0 , the variation trend of piezoelectric constant (d 33) and electromechanical coupling coefficient (k p) is different from that of the ferroelectric polarization direction number ((e-f)). With the increase of x, the values of d 33 and k p increase first and then decrease, and reach their maximum values at the x = 0.100 component ((f)). For the multiphase coexistence of piezoelectric solid solutions, as the composition approaches the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB), the Gibbs free energy profile related to the polarization switching between different ferroelectric phases will become flatter ((f)), the corresponding polarization switching will be easier, and the piezoelectricity will be enhanced. This is usually manifested by the fact that the d 33 and k p of the piezoceramics reach their maximum values at the MPB. Conversely, when the composition deviates from the MPB, the d 33 and k p values gradually decrease. Therefore, in this work, the x = 0.100 component with the largest d 33\u223c550 pC/N and k p\u223c0.687 is denoted as the MPB component. The results above mean that the expectation of constructing MPB based on R phase regulation to obtain a high d 33 has been achieved. (a-e) show the relationship between the dielectric constant (\u03b5 r) and the dielectric loss (tan\u03b4) of the poled P(ZN) x (HT)1-x piezoceramics with temperature at different test frequencies. From room temperature to 340 \xb0C, all the P(ZN) x (HT)1-x ceramic samples have a unique and obvious \u03b5 r and tan\u03b4 anomaly peaks. In the horizontal direction, there is no significant difference in the peak position of the \u03b5 r anomaly peak of all piezoceramics at different test frequencies. Further, the temperature of the corresponding \u03b5 r anomaly peak extracted from the dielectric temperature spectrum is plotted in (f). At different frequencies, the temperature corresponding to the peak value of the \u03b5 r anomaly peak of the P(ZN) x (HT)1-x piezoceramics almost coincides, with a difference of only about 1 \xb0C. Therefore, the temperature corresponding to the \u03b5 r anomaly peak of the P(ZN) x (HT)1-x piezoceramics in this work is the ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition temperature, which is recorded as the Curie temperature (T C). The T C value decreases with the increase of PZN content (x), which is due to the characteristic temperature (T m\u223c140 \xb0C) of the PZN relaxor is lower than the T C (\u223c347 \xb0C) of the PHT ferroelectric. However, it is worth noting that the T C of the x = 0.100 MPB component with the largest d 33 is as high as 311 \xb0C. According to the general law of industrial application, the upper limit of safe use temperature of piezoelectric ceramics is generally no more than 1/2T C. When d 33 is 550 pC/N, the T C of the x = 0.100 MPB component is higher than 300 \xb0C, which is superior to most commercial PZT-based piezoceramics , making it highly competitive in wide temperature range applications. (a) shows the room temperature \u03b5 r of the poled P(ZN) x (HT)1-x piezoceramics. On the whole, the \u03b5 r decreases with the increase of the rhombohedral PZN content (x), which is similar to the decreasing trend of T phase fraction, but opposite to the increasing trend of R phase fraction ((d)). This phenomenon is consistent with our expectation that the ferroelectric polarization (P) may be modulated by adjusting the phase composition, thereby reducing \u03b5 r because of \u03b5 r=P/E\u03b50+1. Taking a single ferroelectric cell as an example, in theory, a T phase has six possible spontaneous polarization (P s) directions, and the angle between adjacent polarization directions is 90\xb0, while a R phase has eight possible spontaneous polarization directions, and the angle between adjacent polarization directions is 71\xb0 ((b)). Therefore, the ferroelectric polarization deflection (\u0394P) in the R phase may be smaller than that in the T phase, resulting in a smaller \u0394P and a lower \u03b5 r (or (dP/dE) E=0), as shown in (b). In order to verify the analysis above, the ferroelectric test of the P(ZN) x (HT)1-x piezoceramics was carried out and the polarization-electric field (P-E) loops were drawn in (c). All the P(ZN) x (HT)1-x piezoceramics exhibit nearly rectangular P-E loops, indicating that they have good ferroelectricity. Further, the \u0394P (=P s-P r) values were calculated and plotted in (d). With the rhombohedral PZN content (x) increasing, the \u0394P of the P(ZN) x (HT)1-x system is opposite to the increasing trend of R phase fraction ((d) and (d)), which is similar to the decreasing trend of \u03b5 r ((a)). Therefore, the decrease of \u03b5 r in this work should be attributed to the increase of rhombohedral phase content accompanied by the smaller ferroelectric polarization variation, which is consistent with our initial assumption. (a) shows the normalized d 33 and \u03b5 r of the P(ZN) x (HT)1-x piezoceramics. With the increase of rhombohedral PZN content (x), the change trend of d 33 and \u03b5 r is not the same: d 33 increases first and then decreases, and \u03b5 r decreases gradually. This decoupling behavior of d 33 and \u03b5 r is very beneficial to obtain a high FoM33. In particular, the MPB component with x = 0.100 exhibits a high d 33 and a low \u03b5 r, which makes it have the largest FoM33 (\u223c17.4 pmE^{2}/N). (b) further gives the FoM33 and T C values of different perovskite lead-based piezoceramics. The optimal x = 0.100 MPB component (PZNHT) in this work has high values of both FoM33 and T C, which are superior to those of many typical lead-based perovskite piezoceramics. This result means that the PZNHT material will be a very promising candidate for piezoelectric energy harvesting applications over a wide temperature range. (a) shows the schematic diagram of a common cantilever piezoelectric energy harvester (PEH) with simple structure and good adjustability and its related equivalent test circuit, in which the piezoceramic is installed near the fixed end of the cantilever beam. All the energy harvesting tests in this work were carried out at the resonant frequency (\u223c89.4 Hz) and 1 g acceleration of the PEH. Under the excitation of sinusoidal alternating force, the PEH assembled by the PZNHT (x = 0.1) piezoceramic generates a good open-circuit voltage (V Open) sine wave signal and a short-circuit current (I SC) sine wave signal when the state 1 switch and the state 2 switch are connected respectively ((b-c)). The peak-to-peak values of V Open and I SC of the PZNHT PEH are 56 V and 83 \u03bcA (corresponding current density\u223c102 \u03bcA/cmE^{2}), respectively. Further, when the state 3 switch is on, the output power density (u) of the PZNHT PEH increases first and then decreases with the increase of the external load (R) value in the circuit. When the external load (R\u223c723 k\u03a9) matches the internal resistance of the PZNHT PEH, the u value of the PZNHT PEH reaches a maximum of about 5.6 mW/cmE^{3}. Furthermore, (e) compares the u values of the PZNHT PEH and other reported typical cantilever PEHs. It can be seen that the u value of the PZNHT PEH is significantly better than that of other PEHs assembled by the PZT- or PZN-based perovskite ceramics. This is mainly due to the high FoM33 of the PZNHT piezoceramics due to the decoupling of the d 33 and \u03b5 r. The above energy harvesting test results intuitively show that the PZNHT piezoceramic with excellent electromechanical conversion ability is a highly competitive stock material in piezoelectric energy harvesting applications.

# ABSTRACT
The core of realizing large output power density (u) of piezoelectric energy harvesters (PEHs) is to develop piezoceramics with a high figure of merit (FoM33, =d

A large FoM33 ∼17.4 pm2/N is achieved in the Pb(Zn1/3Nb2/3)0.1(Hf0.49Ti0.51)0.9O3 (PZNHT) MPB component with a high Curie temperature of 311 °C, which is superior to that of most typical perovskite piezoceramics. Benefitting from this, the PEH assembled by the PZNHT ceramic exhibits a higher output power density (u ∼5.6 mW/cm3) than many reported PEHs.

# INTRODUCTION
Piezoelectric energy harvesters (PEHs) use the positive piezoelectric effect of piezoelectric materials to capture the ubiquitous mechanical energy and output clean electrical energy. As the heart of PEH for electromechanical conversion, piezoceramics have become a kind of widely studied piezoelectric energy harvesting materials due to their simple preparation process and stable performance. The key to the development of PEHs with a high output power density (u) is to prepare piezoceramics with a large figure of merit (FoM33, =d 33 E^{2}/\u03b5 0 \u03b5 r) , and the core is to realize the decoupling of piezoelectric constant (d 33) and dielectric constant (\u03b5 r). Unfortunately, the simultaneous realization of high d 33 and low \u03b5 r in piezoceramics seems unlikely and challenging. Both of them are almost the same high or low, which is clearly reflected in the widely used soft and hard commercial Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PZT) based piezoceramics: high d 33 and high \u03b5 r in the commercial soft PZT (e.g., PZT-5H: d 33\u223c590 pC/N, \u03b5 r\u223c3400) prepared based on donor doping strategy and low d 33 and low \u03b5 r in the commercial hard PZT (e.g., PZT-8: d 33\u223c220 pC/N, \u03b5 r\u223c1000) prepared based on acceptor doping strategy. This situation is very unfavorable for commercial PZT piezoceramics to show a large FoM33 and a high u. In addition to the doping strategy, the complex phase strategy is used to manipulate the change behavior of d 33 and \u03b5 r. Recently, non-ferroelectric second phases such as air and inorganic non-metallic oxides with low \u03b5 r have been introduced into the perovskite piezoelectric matrix to construct 0\u20133 type and 2\u20132 type composite piezoceramics. Although the d 33 of some composite ceramics shows a slower decay rate than the \u03b5 r, the simultaneous reduction of the two still results in a limited increase in the FoM33, and the corresponding PEHs show a weak u. Textured ceramics can also be regarded as a 0\u20133 type composite ceramics. Benefiting from grain orientation growth and low \u03b5 r template phase, textured piezoceramics usually show a large FoM33 (e.g., [001]c-textured PNN-PZT piezoceramic with a FoM33\u223c21.92 pmE^{2}/N ). Therefore, the major challenge in developing piezoelectric energy harvesting ceramics with high values both of FoM33 and u is to increase d 33 and reduce \u03b5 r. Constructing morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) is an effective means to obtain a high d 33. For perovskite piezoelectrics, the \u03b5 r is closely related to ferroelectric polarization (P) because of \u03b5 r=P/E\u03b50+1. Taking the common tetragonal ferroelectric phase and the rhombohedral ferroelectric phase as examples, the tetragonal phase has six possible ferroelectric polarization directions along <001>, and the angle between adjacent polarization directions is 90\xb0, while the rhombohedral phase has eight possible ferroelectric polarization directions along <111> and the angle between adjacent polarization directions is 71\xb0. And then when the electric field is removed, the partial polarization in the tetragonal phase and the rhombohedral phase may be reversed back to the initial directions of 90\xb0 and 71\xb0, respectively. This means that after the electric field is removed, the polarization change (\u0394P) in the rhombohedral ferroelectric phase should be less than that in the tetragonal ferroelectric phase, resulting in a smaller \u03b5 r (or (dP/dE) E=0) value in the rhombohedral ferroelectric phase. Therefore, a strategy for manipulating ferroelectric polarization and constructing MPB is proposed, that is, increasing the rhombohedral phase ratio to modulate the ferroelectric polarization, reduce \u03b5 r, while forming a MPB to increase d 33, so as to achieve high FoM33 and large u. To verify the proposed strategy, a perovskite Pb(Zn1/3Nb2/3) x (Hf0.49Ti0.51)1-x O3 (P(ZN) x (HT)1-x ) ternary system was designed and investigated, where the independent variable is the PZN unit with a rhombohedral structure. Encouragingly, the d 33 increases and the \u03b5 r decreases in the P(ZN) x (HT)1-x piezoceramic system. Benefitting from this, the Pb(Zn1/3Nb2/3)0.1(Hf0.49Ti0.51)0.9O3 ceramic at the MPB not only exhibits a large FoM33 of 17.4 pmE^{2}/N, but also the PEH constructed by it exhibits a high u of 5.6 mW/cmE^{3}, which exceed those of many reported typical perovskite piezoceramics. This work provides an effective optimization strategy for decoupling d 33 and \u03b5 r to construct advanced piezoceramics with outstanding energy harvesting characteristics.

# CONCLUSION
The P(ZN)0.1(HT)0.9 piezoceramic at MPB exhibits a large FoM33 of 17.4 pmE^{2}/N with a high T c of 311 \xb0C. This excellent energy harvesting-related technical parameter is attributed to the ferroelectric polarization modulation and morphotropic phase boundary construction generated by manipulating the rhombohedral phase, thereby achieving the decoupling of the d 33 and \u03b5 r. Additionally, benefiting from its large FoM33, the PEH constructed from the P(ZN)0.1(HT)0.9 ceramic exhibits an outstanding output power density of up to 5.6 mW/cmE^{3}. The remarkable comprehensive performance above makes the P(ZN)0.1(HT)0.9 piezoceramic surpass many typical perovskite piezoelectric materials, showing great potential in the field of piezoelectric energy harvesting.

The \u2160 and \u2162 peaks with more prominent initial peak shape gradually weakened, while the \u2161 peaks in the middle gradually increased ((b)). This means that changing the PZN content (x) can effectively adjust the phase structure of the P(ZN) x (HT)1-x system. For the typical perovskite Pb(Hf,Ti)O3, Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 and BiScO3-PbTiO3 based piezoceramics with multiphase coexistence characteristic, the (002) and (200) characteristic peaks near 45\xb0 can usually be separated into the (002)T and (200)T peaks corresponding to the tetragonal (T) ferroelectric phase and the (200)R peak corresponding to the rhombohedral (R) ferroelectric phase, respectively. Taking the x = 0.100 ceramic sample as an example, the (002)T, (200)R and (200)T peaks fitted by the Lorentz function are shown in (c). Subsequently, the intensity (I) of different fitting peaks was read and the T phase fraction and R phase fraction of the corresponding ceramic samples were calculated according to the T = (I(002)T+I(200)T))/(I(002)T+I(200)R+I(200)T) and R = I(200)R /(I(002)T+I(200)R+I(200)T) formulas. (d) shows the T phase fraction and R phase fraction of the different P(ZN) x (HT)1-x ceramics. With the increase of PZN content (x) with R phase characteristic in the system, the T phase fraction gradually decreases, while the R phase gradually increases. This is consistent with our expectation, that is, the regulation of the R ferroelectric phase of the system provides fertile ground for the formation of MPB and the optimization of the ferroelectric polarization characteristics. The total number of spontaneous polarization directions increases with the increase of PZN content (x), which is consistent with the change trend of R phase fraction ((d-e)). However, when the phase angles (\u03b8 = 85\u201386\xb0) of all the P(ZN) x (HT)1-x ceramic samples are close and tend to be ideal \u03b8\u223c90\xb0 , the variation trend of piezoelectric constant (d 33) and electromechanical coupling coefficient (k p) is different from that of the ferroelectric polarization direction number ((e-f)). With the increase of x, the values of d 33 and k p increase first and then decrease, and reach their maximum values at the x = 0.100 component ((f)). For the multiphase coexistence of piezoelectric solid solutions, as the composition approaches the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB), the Gibbs free energy profile related to the polarization switching between different ferroelectric phases will become flatter ((f)), the corresponding polarization switching will be easier, and the piezoelectricity will be enhanced. This is usually manifested by the fact that the d 33 and k p of the piezoceramics reach their maximum values at the MPB. Conversely, when the composition deviates from the MPB, the d 33 and k p values gradually decrease. Therefore, in this work, the x = 0.100 component with the largest d 33\u223c550 pC/N and k p\u223c0.687 is denoted as the MPB component. The results above mean that the expectation of constructing MPB based on R phase regulation to obtain a high d 33 has been achieved. (a-e) show the relationship between the dielectric constant (\u03b5 r) and the dielectric loss (tan\u03b4) of the poled P(ZN) x (HT)1-x piezoceramics with temperature at different test frequencies. From room temperature to 340 \xb0C, all the P(ZN) x (HT)1-x ceramic samples have a unique and obvious \u03b5 r and tan\u03b4 anomaly peaks. In the horizontal direction, there is no significant difference in the peak position of the \u03b5 r anomaly peak of all piezoceramics at different test frequencies. Further, the temperature of the corresponding \u03b5 r anomaly peak extracted from the dielectric temperature spectrum is plotted in (f). At different frequencies, the temperature corresponding to the peak value of the \u03b5 r anomaly peak of the P(ZN) x (HT)1-x piezoceramics almost coincides, with a difference of only about 1 \xb0C. Therefore, the temperature corresponding to the \u03b5 r anomaly peak of the P(ZN) x (HT)1-x piezoceramics in this work is the ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition temperature, which is recorded as the Curie temperature (T C). The T C value decreases with the increase of PZN content (x), which is due to the characteristic temperature (T m\u223c140 \xb0C) of the PZN relaxor is lower than the T C (\u223c347 \xb0C) of the PHT ferroelectric. However, it is worth noting that the T C of the x = 0.100 MPB component with the largest d 33 is as high as 311 \xb0C. According to the general law of industrial application, the upper limit of safe use temperature of piezoelectric ceramics is generally no more than 1/2T C. When d 33 is 550 pC/N, the T C of the x = 0.100 MPB component is higher than 300 \xb0C, which is superior to most commercial PZT-based piezoceramics , making it highly competitive in wide temperature range applications. (a) shows the room temperature \u03b5 r of the poled P(ZN) x (HT)1-x piezoceramics. On the whole, the \u03b5 r decreases with the increase of the rhombohedral PZN content (x), which is similar to the decreasing trend of T phase fraction, but opposite to the increasing trend of R phase fraction ((d)). This phenomenon is consistent with our expectation that the ferroelectric polarization (P) may be modulated by adjusting the phase composition, thereby reducing \u03b5 r because of \u03b5 r=P/E\u03b50+1. Taking a single ferroelectric cell as an example, in theory, a T phase has six possible spontaneous polarization (P s) directions, and the angle between adjacent polarization directions is 90\xb0, while a R phase has eight possible spontaneous polarization directions, and the angle between adjacent polarization directions is 71\xb0 ((b)). Therefore, the ferroelectric polarization deflection (\u0394P) in the R phase may be smaller than that in the T phase, resulting in a smaller \u0394P and a lower \u03b5 r (or (dP/dE) E=0), as shown in (b). In order to verify the analysis above, the ferroelectric test of the P(ZN) x (HT)1-x piezoceramics was carried out and the polarization-electric field (P-E) loops were drawn in (c). All the P(ZN) x (HT)1-x piezoceramics exhibit nearly rectangular P-E loops, indicating that they have good ferroelectricity. Further, the \u0394P (=P s-P r) values were calculated and plotted in (d). With the rhombohedral PZN content (x) increasing, the \u0394P of the P(ZN) x (HT)1-x system is opposite to the increasing trend of R phase fraction ((d) and (d)), which is similar to the decreasing trend of \u03b5 r ((a)). Therefore, the decrease of \u03b5 r in this work should be attributed to the increase of rhombohedral phase content accompanied by the smaller ferroelectric polarization variation, which is consistent with our initial assumption. (a) shows the normalized d 33 and \u03b5 r of the P(ZN) x (HT)1-x piezoceramics. With the increase of rhombohedral PZN content (x), the change trend of d 33 and \u03b5 r is not the same: d 33 increases first and then decreases, and \u03b5 r decreases gradually. This decoupling behavior of d 33 and \u03b5 r is very beneficial to obtain a high FoM33. In particular, the MPB component with x = 0.100 exhibits a high d 33 and a low \u03b5 r, which makes it have the largest FoM33 (\u223c17.4 pmE^{2}/N). (b) further gives the FoM33 and T C values of different perovskite lead-based piezoceramics. The optimal x = 0.100 MPB component (PZNHT) in this work has high values of both FoM33 and T C, which are superior to those of many typical lead-based perovskite piezoceramics. This result means that the PZNHT material will be a very promising candidate for piezoelectric energy harvesting applications over a wide temperature range. (a) shows the schematic diagram of a common cantilever piezoelectric energy harvester (PEH) with simple structure and good adjustability and its related equivalent test circuit, in which the piezoceramic is installed near the fixed end of the cantilever beam. All the energy harvesting tests in this work were carried out at the resonant frequency (\u223c89.4 Hz) and 1 g acceleration of the PEH. Under the excitation of sinusoidal alternating force, the PEH assembled by the PZNHT (x = 0.1) piezoceramic generates a good open-circuit voltage (V Open) sine wave signal and a short-circuit current (I SC) sine wave signal when the state 1 switch and the state 2 switch are connected respectively ((b-c)). The peak-to-peak values of V Open and I SC of the PZNHT PEH are 56 V and 83 \u03bcA (corresponding current density\u223c102 \u03bcA/cmE^{2}), respectively. Further, when the state 3 switch is on, the output power density (u) of the PZNHT PEH increases first and then decreases with the increase of the external load (R) value in the circuit. When the external load (R\u223c723 k\u03a9) matches the internal resistance of the PZNHT PEH, the u value of the PZNHT PEH reaches a maximum of about 5.6 mW/cmE^{3}. Furthermore, (e) compares the u values of the PZNHT PEH and other reported typical cantilever PEHs. It can be seen that the u value of the PZNHT PEH is significantly better than that of other PEHs assembled by the PZT- or PZN-based perovskite ceramics. This is mainly due to the high FoM33 of the PZNHT piezoceramics due to the decoupling of the d 33 and \u03b5 r. The above energy harvesting test results intuitively show that the PZNHT piezoceramic with excellent electromechanical conversion ability is a highly competitive stock material in piezoelectric energy harvesting applications.

A large FoM33 ∼17.4 pm2/N is achieved in the Pb(Zn1/3Nb2/3)0.1(Hf0.49Ti0.51)0.9O3 (PZNHT) MPB component with a high Curie temperature of 311 °C, which is superior to that of most typical perovskite piezoceramics. Benefitting from this, the PEH assembled by the PZNHT ceramic exhibits a higher output power density (u ∼5.6 mW/cm3) than many reported PEHs.

# INTRODUCTION
Piezoelectric energy harvesters (PEHs) use the positive piezoelectric effect of piezoelectric materials to capture the ubiquitous mechanical energy and output clean electrical energy. As the heart of PEH for electromechanical conversion, piezoceramics have become a kind of widely studied piezoelectric energy harvesting materials due to their simple preparation process and stable performance. The key to the development of PEHs with a high output power density (u) is to prepare piezoceramics with a large figure of merit (FoM33, =d 33 E^{2}/\u03b5 0 \u03b5 r) , and the core is to realize the decoupling of piezoelectric constant (d 33) and dielectric constant (\u03b5 r). Unfortunately, the simultaneous realization of high d 33 and low \u03b5 r in piezoceramics seems unlikely and challenging. Both of them are almost the same high or low, which is clearly reflected in the widely used soft and hard commercial Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PZT) based piezoceramics: high d 33 and high \u03b5 r in the commercial soft PZT (e.g., PZT-5H: d 33\u223c590 pC/N, \u03b5 r\u223c3400) prepared based on donor doping strategy and low d 33 and low \u03b5 r in the commercial hard PZT (e.g., PZT-8: d 33\u223c220 pC/N, \u03b5 r\u223c1000) prepared based on acceptor doping strategy. This situation is very unfavorable for commercial PZT piezoceramics to show a large FoM33 and a high u. In addition to the doping strategy, the complex phase strategy is used to manipulate the change behavior of d 33 and \u03b5 r. Recently, non-ferroelectric second phases such as air and inorganic non-metallic oxides with low \u03b5 r have been introduced into the perovskite piezoelectric matrix to construct 0\u20133 type and 2\u20132 type composite piezoceramics. Although the d 33 of some composite ceramics shows a slower decay rate than the \u03b5 r, the simultaneous reduction of the two still results in a limited increase in the FoM33, and the corresponding PEHs show a weak u. Textured ceramics can also be regarded as a 0\u20133 type composite ceramics. Benefiting from grain orientation growth and low \u03b5 r template phase, textured piezoceramics usually show a large FoM33 (e.g., [001]c-textured PNN-PZT piezoceramic with a FoM33\u223c21.92 pmE^{2}/N ). Therefore, the major challenge in developing piezoelectric energy harvesting ceramics with high values both of FoM33 and u is to increase d 33 and reduce \u03b5 r. Constructing morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) is an effective means to obtain a high d 33. For perovskite piezoelectrics, the \u03b5 r is closely related to ferroelectric polarization (P) because of \u03b5 r=P/E\u03b50+1. Taking the common tetragonal ferroelectric phase and the rhombohedral ferroelectric phase as examples, the tetragonal phase has six possible ferroelectric polarization directions along <001>, and the angle between adjacent polarization directions is 90\xb0, while the rhombohedral phase has eight possible ferroelectric polarization directions along <111> and the angle between adjacent polarization directions is 71\xb0. And then when the electric field is removed, the partial polarization in the tetragonal phase and the rhombohedral phase may be reversed back to the initial directions of 90\xb0 and 71\xb0, respectively. This means that after the electric field is removed, the polarization change (\u0394P) in the rhombohedral ferroelectric phase should be less than that in the tetragonal ferroelectric phase, resulting in a smaller \u03b5 r (or (dP/dE) E=0) value in the rhombohedral ferroelectric phase. Therefore, a strategy for manipulating ferroelectric polarization and constructing MPB is proposed, that is, increasing the rhombohedral phase ratio to modulate the ferroelectric polarization, reduce \u03b5 r, while forming a MPB to increase d 33, so as to achieve high FoM33 and large u. To verify the proposed strategy, a perovskite Pb(Zn1/3Nb2/3) x (Hf0.49Ti0.51)1-x O3 (P(ZN) x (HT)1-x ) ternary system was designed and investigated, where the independent variable is the PZN unit with a rhombohedral structure. Encouragingly, the d 33 increases and the \u03b5 r decreases in the P(ZN) x (HT)1-x piezoceramic system. Benefitting from this, the Pb(Zn1/3Nb2/3)0.1(Hf0.49Ti0.51)0.9O3 ceramic at the MPB not only exhibits a large FoM33 of 17.4 pmE^{2}/N, but also the PEH constructed by it exhibits a high u of 5.6 mW/cmE^{3}, which exceed those of many reported typical perovskite piezoceramics. This work provides an effective optimization strategy for decoupling d 33 and \u03b5 r to construct advanced piezoceramics with outstanding energy harvesting characteristics.

# CONCLUSION
The P(ZN)0.1(HT)0.9 piezoceramic at MPB exhibits a large FoM33 of 17.4 pmE^{2}/N with a high T c of 311 \xb0C. This excellent energy harvesting-related technical parameter is attributed to the ferroelectric polarization modulation and morphotropic phase boundary construction generated by manipulating the rhombohedral phase, thereby achieving the decoupling of the d 33 and \u03b5 r. Additionally, benefiting from its large FoM33, the PEH constructed from the P(ZN)0.1(HT)0.9 ceramic exhibits an outstanding output power density of up to 5.6 mW/cmE^{3}. The remarkable comprehensive performance above makes the P(ZN)0.1(HT)0.9 piezoceramic surpass many typical perovskite piezoelectric materials, showing great potential in the field of piezoelectric energy harvesting.
