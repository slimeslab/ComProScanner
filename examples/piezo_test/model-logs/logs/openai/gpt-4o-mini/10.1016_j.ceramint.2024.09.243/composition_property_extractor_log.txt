# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Initially, the graded powder was fully mixed with resin monomer, photoinitiator and dispersant to obtain BT/HA ceramic slurry with 45 vol% solid content. Then, the BT/HA composite ceramic scaffold was fabricated by VPP 3D printing technology. Finally, the dense BT/HA composite ceramic scaffold was obtained by debinding and sintering treatment. (a) and (b) respectively show the morphology of the green body and the sintered sample. Debinding and sintering the ceramic green body is a key step for VPP 3D printing to form complex ceramic structures. So, before we decide on the atmosphere debinding process, TG-DSC tests were conducted for the BT/HA composite ceramic green body to find the decomposition temperature range of organic matter in it. (c) shows the TG-DSC-DTG curve of the ceramic green body, from which it can be seen that its thermal decomposition is mainly divided into the following three stages: The first stage is to heat up from room temperature to 200 \xb0C, and the weight loss is about 4.65 %. From 100 \xb0C, the DTG curve begins to show an obvious decline, and an obvious peak appears at about 175 \xb0C, indicating that the thermal decomposition rate is faster around this temperature. The DSC curve shows a peak of heat absorption at about 206 \xb0C. The second stage is about 200\u2013500 \xb0C, and the weight loss is about 20.53 %. Two obvious peaks appear in the DTG curve at about 416 \xb0C and 468 \xb0C, indicating that the thermal decomposition rate is fast at these two temperatures. The DSC curve also corresponds to the thermal absorption peak at about 426 \xb0C and 472 \xb0C. The third stage is about 500\u20131000 \xb0C, and the weight loss is about 2.31 %. The DTG curve is relatively stable at this stage, with no obvious peak, and the DSC curve has no obvious heat absorption peak, indicating that the resin has finished thermal decomposition at this stage. The temperature preservation process was set at 175 \xb0C, 416 \xb0C, and 468 \xb0C for 4 h under an argon atmosphere, and the heating rate was 0.5 \xb0C/min between 175 \xb0C and 468 \xb0C, and the other heating rate was 1 \xb0C/min. After debinding in the argon atmosphere, the temperature was first raised to 600 \xb0C at a temperature rate of 2 \xb0C/min, and the decarbonization was carried out under air for 2h. Then, the temperature was continued to 1200 \xb0C, 1250 \xb0C, 1300 \xb0C, 1350 \xb0C, and 1400 \xb0C for sintering for 3 h and subsequent tests were conducted thereafter. The density of the BT/HA composite ceramic sample was measured by the Hydrostatic weighing, and the theoretical density of the BT/HA composite ceramic was calculated to be 5.4288 g/cmE^{3}. The relative density of the BT/HA composite ceramic at different sintering temperatures is shown in (a). It can be seen that when the sintering temperature is 1300 \xb0C, the relative density of BT/HA composite ceramics is relatively large, about 99.18 %, and when the sintering temperature is lower than 1300 \xb0C, the relative density of ceramics is less than 92 %, which attributed to insufficient growth of BT ceramic grains, resulting in heightened internal defects within the ceramics. When the sintering temperature reaches 1350 \xb0C, the relative density of BT/HA composite ceramics decreases to 96.98 %, which may be due to the decomposition of HA, leading to the decline of the overall relative density of BT/HA composite ceramics. When the sintering temperature reaches 1400 \xb0C, the relative density is about 96.91 %. When the sintering temperature rises above 1300 \xb0C, although the shrinkage of BT/HA composite ceramics is still increasing, the relative density of BT/HA composite ceramics begins to decrease to a certain extent. It can be seen that the influence of sintering temperature on BT/HA composite ceramics is very obvious, and sintering at a too-high temperature will reduce the relative density of BT/HA composite ceramics. In (b), the shrinkage rates of BT/HA composite ceramic samples in X, Y, and Z directions were tested at different sintering temperatures. As the sintering temperature rose from 1200 \xb0C to 1400 \xb0C, the shrinkage rates in the three directions continued to increase, indicating that the ceramics were constantly contracting. When the sintering temperature rises above 1300 \xb0C, although the shrinkage of BT/HA composite ceramics is still increasing, the relative density of BT/HA composite ceramics begins to decrease to a certain extent. It can be seen that the influence of sintering temperature on BT/HA composite ceramics is very obvious, and a too high sintering temperature will reduce the relative density of BT/HA composite ceramics. The crystal phase structure of a BT/HA composite ceramic can be analyzed by XRD. The test specimen is a 5 \xd7 5 \xd7 2 mmE^{3} cuboid BT/HA composite ceramic. The phase composition of BT/HA composite ceramics was investigated by XRD at 1200 \xb0C, 1250 \xb0C and 1300 \xb0C. demonstrates that HA reacted with BT (JCPDS 34\u20130129) at 1250 \xb0C, leading to the replacement of BaE^{2+} in the perovskite structure by CaE^{2+} and resulting in the formation of a CaTiO3 (JCPDS 75\u20132100) phase. CaTiO3 is known for its ability to promote cell differentiation and its high biological activity and biocompatibility. Additionally, the synthesis process also yielded a certain amount of (Ba0.70Ca0.30)TiO3 (JCPDS 81\u20131288) and Ba3(PO4)2 (JCPDS 25\u20130028) phases. The released PO4 E^{3\u2212} ions form bioapatite precipitation on the surface of the bioceramics, facilitating new bone growth. Consequently, the formation of CaTiO3 and Ba3(PO4)2 phases during the sintering process enhances the biocompatibility and degradation rate of the BT/HA composite ceramics, potentially benefiting bone repair applications. As depicted in , the characteristic diffraction peaks of the (002) and (200) crystal faces exhibit splitting into 45\xb0 wide peaks, indicative of a tetragonal structure for the prepared BT ceramics. The spontaneous polarization associated with the tetragonal phase of BT demonstrates favorable ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties, which contribute positively to the piezoelectric characteristics of the BT/HA composite ceramics. Therefore, the following experiments were conducted to test and analyze the performance of BT/HA composite ceramics sintered at 1250 \xb0C, 1300 \xb0C, and 1350 \xb0C. As shown in (a), (b), and (c) in the figure are Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) micrographs of BT/HA composite ceramics held at 1250 \xb0C, 1300 \xb0C and 1350 \xb0C for 3 h, respectively. (d), (e), and (f) represent magnified views of the corresponding areas in (a), (b), and (c), respectively. It can be seen from the figure that at the sintering temperature of 1250 \xb0C, BT/HA composite ceramics are not dense enough, and there are more pores and holes, which may be because the BT grains cannot be fully grown at 1250 \xb0C, thus reducing the performance of BT/HA composite ceramics, which is consistent with the relative density results of previous tests. When the sintering temperature increased to 1300 \xb0C, the ceramic grains grew further and fewer pores than samples at other temperatures. When the sintering temperature was increased to 1350 \xb0C, the grains grew abnormally. The micromorphology of BT/HA composite ceramics sintered at 1300 \xb0C was further analyzed, as shown in. It can be seen from the figure that the microstructure of the BT/HA composite ceramic sample is dense. According to EDS analysis, BT is enclosed within the red circle frame, while HA is enclosed within the yellow circle frame, and the two are closely combined. In the experiment, the 3D-printed BT/HA composite ceramics were subjected to an axial compression test, and the stress-strain curve obtained is shown in (a). When the stress reaches the maximum value, the ceramic brittle fracture occurs, the stress of BT/HA composite ceramics decreases linearly and disappears, and the whole test process ends. The maximum compressive strength of BT/HA composite ceramics sintered at 1300 \xb0C is about 44 MPa. This is consistent with the results obtained by XRD analysis and SEM observation above. We additionally conducted flexural strength tests on BT/HA composite ceramics, and the result showed that the flexural strength of BT/HA composite ceramics sintered at 1300 \xb0C stands at approximately 30 MPa. The greater the d 33 , the stronger the response capability of the material to mechanical stress. The change of relative dielectric constant of BT/HA composite ceramics with frequency at different sintering temperatures is shown in (b). With the increase in frequency, the relative dielectric constant of BT/HA composite ceramics decreases continuously. However, the relative dielectric constant of BT/HA composite ceramics obtained at 1300 \xb0C is significantly higher than that at the other two sintering temperatures, and its relative dielectric constant is between 379 and 389. The change of dielectric loss of BT/HA composite ceramics with frequency at different sintering temperatures is shown in (c). With the increase of frequency, the dielectric loss of BT/HA composite ceramics first decreases and then increases, reaching the lowest value at about 500 kHz, but the dielectric loss of BT/HA composite ceramics sintered at 1300 \xb0C is generally lower than the other two temperatures. The hysteresis loops of BT/HA composite ceramics sintered at 1300 \xb0C under different electric field strengths are shown in (d). The strength of the polarized electric field depends on the coercive field (Ec) of piezoelectric ceramics, and the general polarized electric field is at least 2\u20133 times greater than the Ec. It can be seen from (d) that when the polarization electric field is 9 kV/cm, the remnant polarization (P r ) is 0.23 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}, and the Ec is 5.19 kV/cm. Therefore, the range of the polarization electric field strength can be set as 15 kV/cm. Since the pore size and porosity of bone tissue scaffolds have an important impact on the growth of bone scaffolds, cell adsorption, and waste discharge, previous studies have shown that the pore size of bone tissue scaffolds should be between 300 and 500 \u03bcm, and the porosity should be 50 % or above. In addition to the advantages of curvature, the structure generated by the triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) method will be more active in cell differentiation due to its internal interconnectivity. In addition, compared with the typical regular network structure, the nodes of the TPMS structure are smoother, and the pore size changes continuously, which can effectively reduce the stress concentration at the interface with different pore sizes. These properties make TPMS structures suitable for the preparation of bone tissue scaffolds. Therefore, in this paper, TPMS scaffolds with different pore sizes (300 \u03bcm, 400 \u03bcm, 500 \u03bcm) and different porosity (50 %, 60 %, 70 %) were constructed and their properties were studied. Firstly, G-type TPMS cells with dimensions of 1 \xd7 1\xd7 1 mm and porosity of 50 %, 60 %, and 70 % were designed and obtain the theoretical values for the wall thickness and pore size of each cell, as shown in. Next, the scaling coefficient for the nine different structures are derived by dividing the target pore diameters of 300 \u03bcm, 400 \u03bcm, and 500 \u03bcm by the pore size of the cell. Similarly, the sizes of each structure are determined by multiplying the cell size (1 \xd7 1 \xd7 1 mm) by the corresponding scaling coefficient. These filling units are used to fill a 10 \xd7 10 \xd7 10 mm cube to create the scaffold model. The constitutive relation of piezoelectric materials shows the coupling relation between their electrical properties and mechanical properties, and the constitutive equation of piezoelectricity coupling is shown in : Where \u03c3 and \u03b5 are stress and strain, respectively, the relationship between the two depends on the elastic flexibility S and the piezoelectric coefficient d , which determines the electric displacement d and the electric field strength E under the unit stress. \u03bb represents the dielectric displacement per unit electric field. The average piezoelectric coefficient (d 31 , d 32 , d 33 ) is usually used to evaluate the piezoelectric effect, as shown in :  In addition, the piezoelectric properties of biomimetic bone tissue scaffolds can be evaluated by the output voltage, which is defined as shown in : Where \u03a8 is the electric potential of the bone tissue scaffold when it is deformed. However, the TPMS structure can significantly improve the connectivity of the bone tissue scaffolds between the ceramics through the structural advantages of interconnection, thereby improving the piezoelectric performance of the scaffolds. Firstly, the model with different porosity at 300 \u03bcm was simulated. A downward boundary load of 0.5 N along the Z-axis is applied to the top surface, the bottom surface is fixed, and the top surface is grounded. The analysis results show that when the same force is applied in the Z-axis direction, the displacement in the Z-axis direction increases from 2.24\xd710E^{\u22125} mm to 3.21\xd710E^{\u22125} mm with the increase of porosity. At the same time, the output of electric potential increases from 4.10 V to 7.25 V, indicating that under the same polarization condition and the same force, the structure with larger porosity is more prone to deformation and will output a higher voltage. The model with 50 % porosity and different pore sizes was simulated and its stress distribution, strain size and potential output size were calculated, as shown in. The analysis results show that when the same force is applied in the Z-axis direction, the displacement in the Z-axis direction increases from 2.24\xd710E^{\u22125} mm to 3.69\xd710E^{\u22125} mm with the increase of the pore size. At the same time, the output of electric potential increased first and then decreased from 4.10 V, 5.10 V and 4.24 V, respectively. When the pore size was 400 \u03bcm, the output voltage reached a maximum of 5.1 V, indicating that under the same polarization condition and the same force, the output voltage of the support increased first and then decreased. The biomimetic bone tissue scaffolds with different pore sizes and porosity were named 300-50, 300-60, 300-70, 400-50, 400-60, 400-70, 500-50, 500-60, and 500-70, respectively. All structures were designed as cubes with a side length of 10 mm, which were imported into the equipment for printing, respectively. The porosity from left to right in the figure is 50 %, 60 %, and 70 %, respectively. Following debinding, the samples were introduced into the sintering furnace, where decarbonization occurred at 600 \xb0C, followed by a 3-h dwell period at 1300 \xb0C. The sample obtained by sintering of BT/HA composite ceramic biomimetic bone tissue scaffold is shown in (d), (e) and (f). After sintering, the scaffolds were cut, and internal wall thickness was measured at 10 randomly selected locations using a caliper. In this experiment, the axial compression test was performed on the fabricated BT/HA composite ceramic biomimetic bone tissue scaffold ceramic lattice structure. (a) shows the compressive strength of BT/HA composite ceramics with different pore sizes and different porosity. The compressive strength of BT/HA composite ceramics with 50 %, 60 % and 70 % porosity of 300 \u03bcm pore size was 2.63 MPa, 1.77 MPa and 1.67 MPa, respectively. Under the same pore size and different porosity structure, the mechanical properties of BT/HA composite ceramics decreased significantly with the increase of porosity. The compressive strength of BT/HA composite ceramics with 300 \u03bcm, 400 \u03bcm and 500 \u03bcm pore sizes at 50 % porosity is 2.63 MPa, 2.90 MPa and 4.26 MPa, respectively. In general, the porosity had a great effect on the mechanical properties of BT/HA composite ceramics. With the increase of porosity, the mechanical properties of BT/HA composite ceramics decreased significantly. Pore size has little effect on the mechanical properties of BT/HA composite ceramics. With the increase of pore size, the mechanical properties of BT/HA composite ceramics show an upward trend. According to the previous test results of the electric hysteresis loop, the polarization electric field strength was set at 15 kV/cm to polarize BT/HA composite ceramic biomimetic bone tissue scaffolds with different pore sizes and porosity. Because the BT/HA composite ceramic biomimetic bone tissue scaffold height is 10 mm, the DC voltage of polarization is set to 15 kV, the polarization time is 30 min, and the polarization temperature is 60 \xb0C. The d 33 of the biomimetic bone tissue scaffold is shown in (b). It can be seen from the figure that d 33 ranges between 2 and 9 pC/N, which meets the requirements of cancellous bone electrical properties. Porosity has a great effect on the electrical properties of BT/HA composite ceramics. With the increase of porosity, the d 33 of BT/HA composite ceramics decreases significantly. The influence of pore size on the d 33 of the BT/HA composite ceramic is relatively minor compared to that of porosity. With the increase of pore size, the d 33 of the scaffold shows a decreasing trend.

# ABSTRACT
BaTiO3/Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 composite ceramic is an outstanding representative of piezoelectric biomaterials, with excellent biocompatibility and piezoelectric effect, and has potential applications in the field of bone tissue repair. In this work, vat photopolymerization 3D printing technology was used to fabricate triply periodic minimal surface structure BaTiO3/Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 composite ceramic bone tissue scaffolds with different pore sizes and porosity, and their mechanical and electrical properties were studied. First, the ceramic slurry configuration process was optimized to obtain a ceramic slurry with high solid content (45 vol%) and excellent rheological properties. The results show that when sintering at 1300 °C, the BaTiO3/Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 composite ceramic has the highest relative density (99.18 %), the highest compressive strength (44 MPa), large relative dielectric constant (379–389), and low dielectric loss. The polarization electric field strength of the BaTiO3/Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 composite ceramic was set to 15 kV/cm through the test of the hysteresis loop. The results show that as the porosity increases and the pore size decreases, the mechanical properties of the scaffold decrease significantly, and its compressive strength ranges between 1.67 and 4.26 MPa; as the porosity increases and the pore size increases, the piezoelectric coefficient (d

# INTRODUCTION
The emergence of bone repair materials injected new vitality to the treatment of clinical bone defects, and the continuous development of bone tissue engineering has brought new hope to patients  The research findings reveal that upon insertion into the human body, hydroxyapatite (Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2, HA) fosters osteoblast-mediated bone matrix formation on its surface, facilitating direct bone tissue growth. This is important evidence that HA has osteogenic ability. HA can also combine with new bone to form mineralization, and its performance is similar to the fracture healing phenomenon. Julius Wolff in 1892 came up with what came to be known as \u201cwolf's law\u201d, which s tated that bone itself would remodel its structure in response to external stress. Halperin et al.  studied the variation of the piezoelectric strain coefficient value of human tibia in the range of 7.7\u20138.7 pC/N. Barium titanate (BaTiO3, BT) piezoelectric ceramic is a biologically inert ceramic material with stable composition, non-toxic and non-distorting effects. To further enhance the biological activity of BT piezoelectric ceramics, a commonly used method is to combine HA with BT. BT/HA materials have garnered significant attention from scholars as well. Swain et al.  cultured macrophages in vitro using polarized BT/HA composite ceramics and found that polarized BT/HA composite ceramics have better immune compatibility and can be used in bone tissue engineering applications. Then Swain et al.  further studied BT/HA composite ceramics containing strontium and found that the polarized composite enhanced osteoblast growth while reducing the possibility of bacterial infection. Wu et al.  explored the biocompatibility of BT/HA composite ceramics with different content ratios and believed that the composition of BT/HA = 7/3 is more conducive to osteoblast proliferation. Tavangar et al.  used cold isostatic sintering to prepare BT/HA composite scaffolds and proved that the addition of BT enhanced the mechanical and electrical properties of HA, and more apatite was deposited on the surface of BT/HA scaffolds after soaking in SBF solution. Jiao et al.  studied the mechanical and electrical properties of BT/HA composites prepared by the hydrothermal method and found that its compressive strength was 67.32 MPa and its d 33 was 0.61 pC/N, closely resembling the 0.7 pC/N measurement found in human dry bone. Ozcelik et al.  used the powder metallurgy method to prepare BT/HA with different BT contents and tested its performance after sintering at different temperatures and atmospheres. It was found that BT/HA composites with BT concentration less than 95 wt% had no piezoelectric response, and composites containing BT could promote osteoblast adhesion better than pure HA. Senthilkumar et al.  used plasma spraying technology to coat BT/HA on stainless steel and found that the composite ceramic film containing BT could better promote the growth and biomineralization process of osteoblasts than samples with only HA. In the past decade, with the development of 3D printing technology in science, engineering and medicine, it is now possible to create new bone tissue scaffolds with customized shapes, good microstructure, mechanical strength, and biological properties. Mystiridou et al.  prepared the PLA/PCL/HA/BT scaffold by the 3D printing method of melt deposition and tested its piezoelectric and dielectric properties. The d 33 and dielectric constant of the scaffold were close to human bone. Polley et al.  used direct ink writing 3D printing technology to fabricate BT/HA composite ceramic scaffolds, which have good cytocompatibility and cell adhesion and have piezoelectric properties similar to those of human bone, with a piezoelectric constant of 3 pC/N. Chen et al.  used vat photopolymerization (VPP) technology to fabricate a BT/HA bone tissue scaffold with a d 33 of 2.15 pC/N. In vitro analyses revealed that, under LIPUS treatment, the BT/HA piezoelectric ceramic scaffold showed a pronounced ability to foster osteogenic differentiation of DPSCs. Xue et al.  used VPP technology to fabricate a BT/HA bone tissue scaffold, the scaffold shows excellent dielectric properties (518.7), biological properties, and a high piezoelectric sensing output voltage (8V). VPP technology has the characteristics of rapid forming speed, high precision, fast curing rate, low cost, and capability to form complex ceramic structures. At present, there remains insufficient discussion on the regulation in mechanical and electrical properties in BT/HA composite ceramic porous structure through configuration characteristic parameters. In this work, a BT/HA composite ceramic bone tissue scaffold body was fabricated using VPP technology. The impact of various sintering processes on the mechanical and electrical properties of BT/HA composite ceramics was systematically investigated. The polarization electric field strength of BT/HA composite ceramics was set through analyzing the electric hysteresis loop. Based on the research on obtaining high relative density BT/HA composite ceramics, BT/HA composite ceramics with different pore sizes and porosity were designed and their effects on electromechanical properties were simulated. A BT/HA porous structural bone tissue scaffold with tunable electromechanical properties was fabricated, and the correlation between pore size, porosity, and electromechanical properties of the scaffold was evaluated.

# CONCLUSION
In this paper, VPP 3D printing technology was used to combine the piezoelectric ceramic BT and the biological ceramic HA to fabricate BT/HA composite ceramics. The optimal sintering temperature was determined by sample shrinkage test, relative density test, XRD analysis, SEM analysis, and other characterization methods. After sintering at 1300 \xb0C for 3 h, the compressive strength of the BT/HA composite ceramic can reach up to 44 MPa, and the relative density can reach up to 99.18 %. BT/HA composite ceramic has a stable tetragonal phase, HA is stably distributed on the BT surface, and the internal pores and defects of BT/HA composite ceramic are the least, and the grain size distribution is relatively uniform. The P r and Ec are 0.23 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} and 5.19 kV/cm, respectively, when the polarization electric field is 9 kV/cm, and the optimal polarization electric field strength is 15 kV/cm. By regulating the thickness and size of the single cell wall, the BT/HA bone tissue scaffold with three different pore sizes of 300 \u03bcm, 400 \u03bcm and 500 \u03bcm and three different porosity of 50 %, 60 % and 70 % was fabricated, and its mechanical and electrical properties were simulated and tested. The compressive strength ranged from 1.67 MPa to 4.26 MPa, which met the mechanical properties of cancellous bone. With the increase of porosity, the d 33 of the scaffold decreased significantly, and with the increase of pore size, the d 33 showed a decreasing trend. The d 33 ranges from 2 to 9 pC/N, which meets the electrical properties of cancellous bone. The above results indicate that this work provides a new idea for the application of customized BT/HA composite ceramic scaffolds in orthopedic implants.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Initially, the graded powder was fully mixed with resin monomer, photoinitiator and dispersant to obtain BT/HA ceramic slurry with 45 vol% solid content. Then, the BT/HA composite ceramic scaffold was fabricated by VPP 3D printing technology. Finally, the dense BT/HA composite ceramic scaffold was obtained by debinding and sintering treatment. (a) and (b) respectively show the morphology of the green body and the sintered sample. Debinding and sintering the ceramic green body is a key step for VPP 3D printing to form complex ceramic structures. So, before we decide on the atmosphere debinding process, TG-DSC tests were conducted for the BT/HA composite ceramic green body to find the decomposition temperature range of organic matter in it. (c) shows the TG-DSC-DTG curve of the ceramic green body, from which it can be seen that its thermal decomposition is mainly divided into the following three stages: The first stage is to heat up from room temperature to 200 \xb0C, and the weight loss is about 4.65 %. From 100 \xb0C, the DTG curve begins to show an obvious decline, and an obvious peak appears at about 175 \xb0C, indicating that the thermal decomposition rate is faster around this temperature. The DSC curve shows a peak of heat absorption at about 206 \xb0C. The second stage is about 200\u2013500 \xb0C, and the weight loss is about 20.53 %. Two obvious peaks appear in the DTG curve at about 416 \xb0C and 468 \xb0C, indicating that the thermal decomposition rate is fast at these two temperatures. The DSC curve also corresponds to the thermal absorption peak at about 426 \xb0C and 472 \xb0C. The third stage is about 500\u20131000 \xb0C, and the weight loss is about 2.31 %. The DTG curve is relatively stable at this stage, with no obvious peak, and the DSC curve has no obvious heat absorption peak, indicating that the resin has finished thermal decomposition at this stage. The temperature preservation process was set at 175 \xb0C, 416 \xb0C, and 468 \xb0C for 4 h under an argon atmosphere, and the heating rate was 0.5 \xb0C/min between 175 \xb0C and 468 \xb0C, and the other heating rate was 1 \xb0C/min. After debinding in the argon atmosphere, the temperature was first raised to 600 \xb0C at a temperature rate of 2 \xb0C/min, and the decarbonization was carried out under air for 2h. Then, the temperature was continued to 1200 \xb0C, 1250 \xb0C, 1300 \xb0C, 1350 \xb0C, and 1400 \xb0C for sintering for 3 h and subsequent tests were conducted thereafter. The density of the BT/HA composite ceramic sample was measured by the Hydrostatic weighing, and the theoretical density of the BT/HA composite ceramic was calculated to be 5.4288 g/cmE^{3}. The relative density of the BT/HA composite ceramic at different sintering temperatures is shown in (a). It can be seen that when the sintering temperature is 1300 \xb0C, the relative density of BT/HA composite ceramics is relatively large, about 99.18 %, and when the sintering temperature is lower than 1300 \xb0C, the relative density of ceramics is less than 92 %, which attributed to insufficient growth of BT ceramic grains, resulting in heightened internal defects within the ceramics. When the sintering temperature reaches 1350 \xb0C, the relative density of BT/HA composite ceramics decreases to 96.98 %, which may be due to the decomposition of HA, leading to the decline of the overall relative density of BT/HA composite ceramics. When the sintering temperature reaches 1400 \xb0C, the relative density is about 96.91 %. When the sintering temperature rises above 1300 \xb0C, although the shrinkage of BT/HA composite ceramics is still increasing, the relative density of BT/HA composite ceramics begins to decrease to a certain extent. It can be seen that the influence of sintering temperature on BT/HA composite ceramics is very obvious, and sintering at a too-high temperature will reduce the relative density of BT/HA composite ceramics. In (b), the shrinkage rates of BT/HA composite ceramic samples in X, Y, and Z directions were tested at different sintering temperatures. As the sintering temperature rose from 1200 \xb0C to 1400 \xb0C, the shrinkage rates in the three directions continued to increase, indicating that the ceramics were constantly contracting. When the sintering temperature rises above 1300 \xb0C, although the shrinkage of BT/HA composite ceramics is still increasing, the relative density of BT/HA composite ceramics begins to decrease to a certain extent. It can be seen that the influence of sintering temperature on BT/HA composite ceramics is very obvious, and a too high sintering temperature will reduce the relative density of BT/HA composite ceramics. The crystal phase structure of a BT/HA composite ceramic can be analyzed by XRD. The test specimen is a 5 \xd7 5 \xd7 2 mmE^{3} cuboid BT/HA composite ceramic. The phase composition of BT/HA composite ceramics was investigated by XRD at 1200 \xb0C, 1250 \xb0C and 1300 \xb0C. demonstrates that HA reacted with BT (JCPDS 34\u20130129) at 1250 \xb0C, leading to the replacement of BaE^{2+} in the perovskite structure by CaE^{2+} and resulting in the formation of a CaTiO3 (JCPDS 75\u20132100) phase. CaTiO3 is known for its ability to promote cell differentiation and its high biological activity and biocompatibility. Additionally, the synthesis process also yielded a certain amount of (Ba0.70Ca0.30)TiO3 (JCPDS 81\u20131288) and Ba3(PO4)2 (JCPDS 25\u20130028) phases. The released PO4 E^{3\u2212} ions form bioapatite precipitation on the surface of the bioceramics, facilitating new bone growth. Consequently, the formation of CaTiO3 and Ba3(PO4)2 phases during the sintering process enhances the biocompatibility and degradation rate of the BT/HA composite ceramics, potentially benefiting bone repair applications. As depicted in , the characteristic diffraction peaks of the (002) and (200) crystal faces exhibit splitting into 45\xb0 wide peaks, indicative of a tetragonal structure for the prepared BT ceramics. The spontaneous polarization associated with the tetragonal phase of BT demonstrates favorable ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties, which contribute positively to the piezoelectric characteristics of the BT/HA composite ceramics. Therefore, the following experiments were conducted to test and analyze the performance of BT/HA composite ceramics sintered at 1250 \xb0C, 1300 \xb0C, and 1350 \xb0C. As shown in (a), (b), and (c) in the figure are Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) micrographs of BT/HA composite ceramics held at 1250 \xb0C, 1300 \xb0C and 1350 \xb0C for 3 h, respectively. (d), (e), and (f) represent magnified views of the corresponding areas in (a), (b), and (c), respectively. It can be seen from the figure that at the sintering temperature of 1250 \xb0C, BT/HA composite ceramics are not dense enough, and there are more pores and holes, which may be because the BT grains cannot be fully grown at 1250 \xb0C, thus reducing the performance of BT/HA composite ceramics, which is consistent with the relative density results of previous tests. When the sintering temperature increased to 1300 \xb0C, the ceramic grains grew further and fewer pores than samples at other temperatures. When the sintering temperature was increased to 1350 \xb0C, the grains grew abnormally. The micromorphology of BT/HA composite ceramics sintered at 1300 \xb0C was further analyzed, as shown in. It can be seen from the figure that the microstructure of the BT/HA composite ceramic sample is dense. According to EDS analysis, BT is enclosed within the red circle frame, while HA is enclosed within the yellow circle frame, and the two are closely combined. In the experiment, the 3D-printed BT/HA composite ceramics were subjected to an axial compression test, and the stress-strain curve obtained is shown in (a). When the stress reaches the maximum value, the ceramic brittle fracture occurs, the stress of BT/HA composite ceramics decreases linearly and disappears, and the whole test process ends. The maximum compressive strength of BT/HA composite ceramics sintered at 1300 \xb0C is about 44 MPa. This is consistent with the results obtained by XRD analysis and SEM observation above. We additionally conducted flexural strength tests on BT/HA composite ceramics, and the result showed that the flexural strength of BT/HA composite ceramics sintered at 1300 \xb0C stands at approximately 30 MPa. The greater the d 33 , the stronger the response capability of the material to mechanical stress. The change of relative dielectric constant of BT/HA composite ceramics with frequency at different sintering temperatures is shown in (b). With the increase in frequency, the relative dielectric constant of BT/HA composite ceramics decreases continuously. However, the relative dielectric constant of BT/HA composite ceramics obtained at 1300 \xb0C is significantly higher than that at the other two sintering temperatures, and its relative dielectric constant is between 379 and 389. The change of dielectric loss of BT/HA composite ceramics with frequency at different sintering temperatures is shown in (c). With the increase of frequency, the dielectric loss of BT/HA composite ceramics first decreases and then increases, reaching the lowest value at about 500 kHz, but the dielectric loss of BT/HA composite ceramics sintered at 1300 \xb0C is generally lower than the other two temperatures. The hysteresis loops of BT/HA composite ceramics sintered at 1300 \xb0C under different electric field strengths are shown in (d). The strength of the polarized electric field depends on the coercive field (Ec) of piezoelectric ceramics, and the general polarized electric field is at least 2\u20133 times greater than the Ec. It can be seen from (d) that when the polarization electric field is 9 kV/cm, the remnant polarization (P r ) is 0.23 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}, and the Ec is 5.19 kV/cm. Therefore, the range of the polarization electric field strength can be set as 15 kV/cm. Since the pore size and porosity of bone tissue scaffolds have an important impact on the growth of bone scaffolds, cell adsorption, and waste discharge, previous studies have shown that the pore size of bone tissue scaffolds should be between 300 and 500 \u03bcm, and the porosity should be 50 % or above. In addition to the advantages of curvature, the structure generated by the triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) method will be more active in cell differentiation due to its internal interconnectivity. In addition, compared with the typical regular network structure, the nodes of the TPMS structure are smoother, and the pore size changes continuously, which can effectively reduce the stress concentration at the interface with different pore sizes. These properties make TPMS structures suitable for the preparation of bone tissue scaffolds. Therefore, in this paper, TPMS scaffolds with different pore sizes (300 \u03bcm, 400 \u03bcm, 500 \u03bcm) and different porosity (50 %, 60 %, 70 %) were constructed and their properties were studied. Firstly, G-type TPMS cells with dimensions of 1 \xd7 1\xd7 1 mm and porosity of 50 %, 60 %, and 70 % were designed and obtain the theoretical values for the wall thickness and pore size of each cell, as shown in. Next, the scaling coefficient for the nine different structures are derived by dividing the target pore diameters of 300 \u03bcm, 400 \u03bcm, and 500 \u03bcm by the pore size of the cell. Similarly, the sizes of each structure are determined by multiplying the cell size (1 \xd7 1 \xd7 1 mm) by the corresponding scaling coefficient. These filling units are used to fill a 10 \xd7 10 \xd7 10 mm cube to create the scaffold model. The constitutive relation of piezoelectric materials shows the coupling relation between their electrical properties and mechanical properties, and the constitutive equation of piezoelectricity coupling is shown in : Where \u03c3 and \u03b5 are stress and strain, respectively, the relationship between the two depends on the elastic flexibility S and the piezoelectric coefficient d , which determines the electric displacement d and the electric field strength E under the unit stress. \u03bb represents the dielectric displacement per unit electric field. The average piezoelectric coefficient (d 31 , d 32 , d 33 ) is usually used to evaluate the piezoelectric effect, as shown in :  In addition, the piezoelectric properties of biomimetic bone tissue scaffolds can be evaluated by the output voltage, which is defined as shown in : Where \u03a8 is the electric potential of the bone tissue scaffold when it is deformed. However, the TPMS structure can significantly improve the connectivity of the bone tissue scaffolds between the ceramics through the structural advantages of interconnection, thereby improving the piezoelectric performance of the scaffolds. Firstly, the model with different porosity at 300 \u03bcm was simulated. A downward boundary load of 0.5 N along the Z-axis is applied to the top surface, the bottom surface is fixed, and the top surface is grounded. The analysis results show that when the same force is applied in the Z-axis direction, the displacement in the Z-axis direction increases from 2.24\xd710E^{\u22125} mm to 3.21\xd710E^{\u22125} mm with the increase of porosity. At the same time, the output of electric potential increases from 4.10 V to 7.25 V, indicating that under the same polarization condition and the same force, the structure with larger porosity is more prone to deformation and will output a higher voltage. The model with 50 % porosity and different pore sizes was simulated and its stress distribution, strain size and potential output size were calculated, as shown in. The analysis results show that when the same force is applied in the Z-axis direction, the displacement in the Z-axis direction increases from 2.24\xd710E^{\u22125} mm to 3.69\xd710E^{\u22125} mm with the increase of the pore size. At the same time, the output of electric potential increased first and then decreased from 4.10 V, 5.10 V and 4.24 V, respectively. When the pore size was 400 \u03bcm, the output voltage reached a maximum of 5.1 V, indicating that under the same polarization condition and the same force, the output voltage of the support increased first and then decreased. The biomimetic bone tissue scaffolds with different pore sizes and porosity were named 300-50, 300-60, 300-70, 400-50, 400-60, 400-70, 500-50, 500-60, and 500-70, respectively. All structures were designed as cubes with a side length of 10 mm, which were imported into the equipment for printing, respectively. The porosity from left to right in the figure is 50 %, 60 %, and 70 %, respectively. Following debinding, the samples were introduced into the sintering furnace, where decarbonization occurred at 600 \xb0C, followed by a 3-h dwell period at 1300 \xb0C. The sample obtained by sintering of BT/HA composite ceramic biomimetic bone tissue scaffold is shown in (d), (e) and (f). After sintering, the scaffolds were cut, and internal wall thickness was measured at 10 randomly selected locations using a caliper. In this experiment, the axial compression test was performed on the fabricated BT/HA composite ceramic biomimetic bone tissue scaffold ceramic lattice structure. (a) shows the compressive strength of BT/HA composite ceramics with different pore sizes and different porosity. The compressive strength of BT/HA composite ceramics with 50 %, 60 % and 70 % porosity of 300 \u03bcm pore size was 2.63 MPa, 1.77 MPa and 1.67 MPa, respectively. Under the same pore size and different porosity structure, the mechanical properties of BT/HA composite ceramics decreased significantly with the increase of porosity. The compressive strength of BT/HA composite ceramics with 300 \u03bcm, 400 \u03bcm and 500 \u03bcm pore sizes at 50 % porosity is 2.63 MPa, 2.90 MPa and 4.26 MPa, respectively. In general, the porosity had a great effect on the mechanical properties of BT/HA composite ceramics. With the increase of porosity, the mechanical properties of BT/HA composite ceramics decreased significantly. Pore size has little effect on the mechanical properties of BT/HA composite ceramics. With the increase of pore size, the mechanical properties of BT/HA composite ceramics show an upward trend. According to the previous test results of the electric hysteresis loop, the polarization electric field strength was set at 15 kV/cm to polarize BT/HA composite ceramic biomimetic bone tissue scaffolds with different pore sizes and porosity. Because the BT/HA composite ceramic biomimetic bone tissue scaffold height is 10 mm, the DC voltage of polarization is set to 15 kV, the polarization time is 30 min, and the polarization temperature is 60 \xb0C. The d 33 of the biomimetic bone tissue scaffold is shown in (b). It can be seen from the figure that d 33 ranges between 2 and 9 pC/N, which meets the requirements of cancellous bone electrical properties. Porosity has a great effect on the electrical properties of BT/HA composite ceramics. With the increase of porosity, the d 33 of BT/HA composite ceramics decreases significantly. The influence of pore size on the d 33 of the BT/HA composite ceramic is relatively minor compared to that of porosity. With the increase of pore size, the d 33 of the scaffold shows a decreasing trend.

# ABSTRACT
BaTiO3/Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 composite ceramic is an outstanding representative of piezoelectric biomaterials, with excellent biocompatibility and piezoelectric effect, and has potential applications in the field of bone tissue repair. In this work, vat photopolymerization 3D printing technology was used to fabricate triply periodic minimal surface structure BaTiO3/Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 composite ceramic bone tissue scaffolds with different pore sizes and porosity, and their mechanical and electrical properties were studied. First, the ceramic slurry configuration process was optimized to obtain a ceramic slurry with high solid content (45 vol%) and excellent rheological properties. The results show that when sintering at 1300 °C, the BaTiO3/Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 composite ceramic has the highest relative density (99.18 %), the highest compressive strength (44 MPa), large relative dielectric constant (379–389), and low dielectric loss. The polarization electric field strength of the BaTiO3/Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 composite ceramic was set to 15 kV/cm through the test of the hysteresis loop. The results show that as the porosity increases and the pore size decreases, the mechanical properties of the scaffold decrease significantly, and its compressive strength ranges between 1.67 and 4.26 MPa; as the porosity increases and the pore size increases, the piezoelectric coefficient (d

# INTRODUCTION
The emergence of bone repair materials injected new vitality to the treatment of clinical bone defects, and the continuous development of bone tissue engineering has brought new hope to patients  The research findings reveal that upon insertion into the human body, hydroxyapatite (Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2, HA) fosters osteoblast-mediated bone matrix formation on its surface, facilitating direct bone tissue growth. This is important evidence that HA has osteogenic ability. HA can also combine with new bone to form mineralization, and its performance is similar to the fracture healing phenomenon. Julius Wolff in 1892 came up with what came to be known as \u201cwolf's law\u201d, which s tated that bone itself would remodel its structure in response to external stress. Halperin et al.  studied the variation of the piezoelectric strain coefficient value of human tibia in the range of 7.7\u20138.7 pC/N. Barium titanate (BaTiO3, BT) piezoelectric ceramic is a biologically inert ceramic material with stable composition, non-toxic and non-distorting effects. To further enhance the biological activity of BT piezoelectric ceramics, a commonly used method is to combine HA with BT. BT/HA materials have garnered significant attention from scholars as well. Swain et al.  cultured macrophages in vitro using polarized BT/HA composite ceramics and found that polarized BT/HA composite ceramics have better immune compatibility and can be used in bone tissue engineering applications. Then Swain et al.  further studied BT/HA composite ceramics containing strontium and found that the polarized composite enhanced osteoblast growth while reducing the possibility of bacterial infection. Wu et al.  explored the biocompatibility of BT/HA composite ceramics with different content ratios and believed that the composition of BT/HA = 7/3 is more conducive to osteoblast proliferation. Tavangar et al.  used cold isostatic sintering to prepare BT/HA composite scaffolds and proved that the addition of BT enhanced the mechanical and electrical properties of HA, and more apatite was deposited on the surface of BT/HA scaffolds after soaking in SBF solution. Jiao et al.  studied the mechanical and electrical properties of BT/HA composites prepared by the hydrothermal method and found that its compressive strength was 67.32 MPa and its d 33 was 0.61 pC/N, closely resembling the 0.7 pC/N measurement found in human dry bone. Ozcelik et al.  used the powder metallurgy method to prepare BT/HA with different BT contents and tested its performance after sintering at different temperatures and atmospheres. It was found that BT/HA composites with BT concentration less than 95 wt% had no piezoelectric response, and composites containing BT could promote osteoblast adhesion better than pure HA. Senthilkumar et al.  used plasma spraying technology to coat BT/HA on stainless steel and found that the composite ceramic film containing BT could better promote the growth and biomineralization process of osteoblasts than samples with only HA. In the past decade, with the development of 3D printing technology in science, engineering and medicine, it is now possible to create new bone tissue scaffolds with customized shapes, good microstructure, mechanical strength, and biological properties. Mystiridou et al.  prepared the PLA/PCL/HA/BT scaffold by the 3D printing method of melt deposition and tested its piezoelectric and dielectric properties. The d 33 and dielectric constant of the scaffold were close to human bone. Polley et al.  used direct ink writing 3D printing technology to fabricate BT/HA composite ceramic scaffolds, which have good cytocompatibility and cell adhesion and have piezoelectric properties similar to those of human bone, with a piezoelectric constant of 3 pC/N. Chen et al.  used vat photopolymerization (VPP) technology to fabricate a BT/HA bone tissue scaffold with a d 33 of 2.15 pC/N. In vitro analyses revealed that, under LIPUS treatment, the BT/HA piezoelectric ceramic scaffold showed a pronounced ability to foster osteogenic differentiation of DPSCs. Xue et al.  used VPP technology to fabricate a BT/HA bone tissue scaffold, the scaffold shows excellent dielectric properties (518.7), biological properties, and a high piezoelectric sensing output voltage (8V). VPP technology has the characteristics of rapid forming speed, high precision, fast curing rate, low cost, and capability to form complex ceramic structures. At present, there remains insufficient discussion on the regulation in mechanical and electrical properties in BT/HA composite ceramic porous structure through configuration characteristic parameters. In this work, a BT/HA composite ceramic bone tissue scaffold body was fabricated using VPP technology. The impact of various sintering processes on the mechanical and electrical properties of BT/HA composite ceramics was systematically investigated. The polarization electric field strength of BT/HA composite ceramics was set through analyzing the electric hysteresis loop. Based on the research on obtaining high relative density BT/HA composite ceramics, BT/HA composite ceramics with different pore sizes and porosity were designed and their effects on electromechanical properties were simulated. A BT/HA porous structural bone tissue scaffold with tunable electromechanical properties was fabricated, and the correlation between pore size, porosity, and electromechanical properties of the scaffold was evaluated.

# CONCLUSION
In this paper, VPP 3D printing technology was used to combine the piezoelectric ceramic BT and the biological ceramic HA to fabricate BT/HA composite ceramics. The optimal sintering temperature was determined by sample shrinkage test, relative density test, XRD analysis, SEM analysis, and other characterization methods. After sintering at 1300 \xb0C for 3 h, the compressive strength of the BT/HA composite ceramic can reach up to 44 MPa, and the relative density can reach up to 99.18 %. BT/HA composite ceramic has a stable tetragonal phase, HA is stably distributed on the BT surface, and the internal pores and defects of BT/HA composite ceramic are the least, and the grain size distribution is relatively uniform. The P r and Ec are 0.23 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} and 5.19 kV/cm, respectively, when the polarization electric field is 9 kV/cm, and the optimal polarization electric field strength is 15 kV/cm. By regulating the thickness and size of the single cell wall, the BT/HA bone tissue scaffold with three different pore sizes of 300 \u03bcm, 400 \u03bcm and 500 \u03bcm and three different porosity of 50 %, 60 % and 70 % was fabricated, and its mechanical and electrical properties were simulated and tested. The compressive strength ranged from 1.67 MPa to 4.26 MPa, which met the mechanical properties of cancellous bone. With the increase of porosity, the d 33 of the scaffold decreased significantly, and with the increase of pore size, the d 33 showed a decreasing trend. The d 33 ranges from 2 to 9 pC/N, which meets the electrical properties of cancellous bone. The above results indicate that this work provides a new idea for the application of customized BT/HA composite ceramic scaffolds in orthopedic implants.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Initially, the graded powder was fully mixed with resin monomer, photoinitiator and dispersant to obtain BT/HA ceramic slurry with 45 vol% solid content. Then, the BT/HA composite ceramic scaffold was fabricated by VPP 3D printing technology. Finally, the dense BT/HA composite ceramic scaffold was obtained by debinding and sintering treatment. (a) and (b) respectively show the morphology of the green body and the sintered sample. Debinding and sintering the ceramic green body is a key step for VPP 3D printing to form complex ceramic structures. So, before we decide on the atmosphere debinding process, TG-DSC tests were conducted for the BT/HA composite ceramic green body to find the decomposition temperature range of organic matter in it. (c) shows the TG-DSC-DTG curve of the ceramic green body, from which it can be seen that its thermal decomposition is mainly divided into the following three stages: The first stage is to heat up from room temperature to 200 \xb0C, and the weight loss is about 4.65 %. From 100 \xb0C, the DTG curve begins to show an obvious decline, and an obvious peak appears at about 175 \xb0C, indicating that the thermal decomposition rate is faster around this temperature. The DSC curve shows a peak of heat absorption at about 206 \xb0C. The second stage is about 200\u2013500 \xb0C, and the weight loss is about 20.53 %. Two obvious peaks appear in the DTG curve at about 416 \xb0C and 468 \xb0C, indicating that the thermal decomposition rate is fast at these two temperatures. The DSC curve also corresponds to the thermal absorption peak at about 426 \xb0C and 472 \xb0C. The third stage is about 500\u20131000 \xb0C, and the weight loss is about 2.31 %. The DTG curve is relatively stable at this stage, with no obvious peak, and the DSC curve has no obvious heat absorption peak, indicating that the resin has finished thermal decomposition at this stage. The temperature preservation process was set at 175 \xb0C, 416 \xb0C, and 468 \xb0C for 4 h under an argon atmosphere, and the heating rate was 0.5 \xb0C/min between 175 \xb0C and 468 \xb0C, and the other heating rate was 1 \xb0C/min. After debinding in the argon atmosphere, the temperature was first raised to 600 \xb0C at a temperature rate of 2 \xb0C/min, and the decarbonization was carried out under air for 2h. Then, the temperature was continued to 1200 \xb0C, 1250 \xb0C, 1300 \xb0C, 1350 \xb0C, and 1400 \xb0C for sintering for 3 h and subsequent tests were conducted thereafter. The density of the BT/HA composite ceramic sample was measured by the Hydrostatic weighing, and the theoretical density of the BT/HA composite ceramic was calculated to be 5.4288 g/cmE^{3}. The relative density of the BT/HA composite ceramic at different sintering temperatures is shown in (a). It can be seen that when the sintering temperature is 1300 \xb0C, the relative density of BT/HA composite ceramics is relatively large, about 99.18 %, and when the sintering temperature is lower than 1300 \xb0C, the relative density of ceramics is less than 92 %, which attributed to insufficient growth of BT ceramic grains, resulting in heightened internal defects within the ceramics. When the sintering temperature reaches 1350 \xb0C, the relative density of BT/HA composite ceramics decreases to 96.98 %, which may be due to the decomposition of HA, leading to the decline of the overall relative density of BT/HA composite ceramics. When the sintering temperature reaches 1400 \xb0C, the relative density is about 96.91 %. When the sintering temperature rises above 1300 \xb0C, although the shrinkage of BT/HA composite ceramics is still increasing, the relative density of BT/HA composite ceramics begins to decrease to a certain extent. It can be seen that the influence of sintering temperature on BT/HA composite ceramics is very obvious, and sintering at a too-high temperature will reduce the relative density of BT/HA composite ceramics. In (b), the shrinkage rates of BT/HA composite ceramic samples in X, Y, and Z directions were tested at different sintering temperatures. As the sintering temperature rose from 1200 \xb0C to 1400 \xb0C, the shrinkage rates in the three directions continued to increase, indicating that the ceramics were constantly contracting. When the sintering temperature rises above 1300 \xb0C, although the shrinkage of BT/HA composite ceramics is still increasing, the relative density of BT/HA composite ceramics begins to decrease to a certain extent. It can be seen that the influence of sintering temperature on BT/HA composite ceramics is very obvious, and a too high sintering temperature will reduce the relative density of BT/HA composite ceramics. The crystal phase structure of a BT/HA composite ceramic can be analyzed by XRD. The test specimen is a 5 \xd7 5 \xd7 2 mmE^{3} cuboid BT/HA composite ceramic. The phase composition of BT/HA composite ceramics was investigated by XRD at 1200 \xb0C, 1250 \xb0C and 1300 \xb0C. demonstrates that HA reacted with BT (JCPDS 34\u20130129) at 1250 \xb0C, leading to the replacement of BaE^{2+} in the perovskite structure by CaE^{2+} and resulting in the formation of a CaTiO3 (JCPDS 75\u20132100) phase. CaTiO3 is known for its ability to promote cell differentiation and its high biological activity and biocompatibility. Additionally, the synthesis process also yielded a certain amount of (Ba0.70Ca0.30)TiO3 (JCPDS 81\u20131288) and Ba3(PO4)2 (JCPDS 25\u20130028) phases. The released PO4 E^{3\u2212} ions form bioapatite precipitation on the surface of the bioceramics, facilitating new bone growth. Consequently, the formation of CaTiO3 and Ba3(PO4)2 phases during the sintering process enhances the biocompatibility and degradation rate of the BT/HA composite ceramics, potentially benefiting bone repair applications. As depicted in , the characteristic diffraction peaks of the (002) and (200) crystal faces exhibit splitting into 45\xb0 wide peaks, indicative of a tetragonal structure for the prepared BT ceramics. The spontaneous polarization associated with the tetragonal phase of BT demonstrates favorable ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties, which contribute positively to the piezoelectric characteristics of the BT/HA composite ceramics. Therefore, the following experiments were conducted to test and analyze the performance of BT/HA composite ceramics sintered at 1250 \xb0C, 1300 \xb0C, and 1350 \xb0C. As shown in (a), (b), and (c) in the figure are Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) micrographs of BT/HA composite ceramics held at 1250 \xb0C, 1300 \xb0C and 1350 \xb0C for 3 h, respectively. (d), (e), and (f) represent magnified views of the corresponding areas in (a), (b), and (c), respectively. It can be seen from the figure that at the sintering temperature of 1250 \xb0C, BT/HA composite ceramics are not dense enough, and there are more pores and holes, which may be because the BT grains cannot be fully grown at 1250 \xb0C, thus reducing the performance of BT/HA composite ceramics, which is consistent with the relative density results of previous tests. When the sintering temperature increased to 1300 \xb0C, the ceramic grains grew further and fewer pores than samples at other temperatures. When the sintering temperature was increased to 1350 \xb0C, the grains grew abnormally. The micromorphology of BT/HA composite ceramics sintered at 1300 \xb0C was further analyzed, as shown in. It can be seen from the figure that the microstructure of the BT/HA composite ceramic sample is dense. According to EDS analysis, BT is enclosed within the red circle frame, while HA is enclosed within the yellow circle frame, and the two are closely combined. In the experiment, the 3D-printed BT/HA composite ceramics were subjected to an axial compression test, and the stress-strain curve obtained is shown in (a). When the stress reaches the maximum value, the ceramic brittle fracture occurs, the stress of BT/HA composite ceramics decreases linearly and disappears, and the whole test process ends. The maximum compressive strength of BT/HA composite ceramics sintered at 1300 \xb0C is about 44 MPa. This is consistent with the results obtained by XRD analysis and SEM observation above. We additionally conducted flexural strength tests on BT/HA composite ceramics, and the result showed that the flexural strength of BT/HA composite ceramics sintered at 1300 \xb0C stands at approximately 30 MPa. The greater the d 33 , the stronger the response capability of the material to mechanical stress. The change of relative dielectric constant of BT/HA composite ceramics with frequency at different sintering temperatures is shown in (b). With the increase in frequency, the relative dielectric constant of BT/HA composite ceramics decreases continuously. However, the relative dielectric constant of BT/HA composite ceramics obtained at 1300 \xb0C is significantly higher than that at the other two sintering temperatures, and its relative dielectric constant is between 379 and 389. The change of dielectric loss of BT/HA composite ceramics with frequency at different sintering temperatures is shown in (c). With the increase of frequency, the dielectric loss of BT/HA composite ceramics first decreases and then increases, reaching the lowest value at about 500 kHz, but the dielectric loss of BT/HA composite ceramics sintered at 1300 \xb0C is generally lower than the other two temperatures. The hysteresis loops of BT/HA composite ceramics sintered at 1300 \xb0C under different electric field strengths are shown in (d). The strength of the polarized electric field depends on the coercive field (Ec) of piezoelectric ceramics, and the general polarized electric field is at least 2\u20133 times greater than the Ec. It can be seen from (d) that when the polarization electric field is 9 kV/cm, the remnant polarization (P r ) is 0.23 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}, and the Ec is 5.19 kV/cm. Therefore, the range of the polarization electric field strength can be set as 15 kV/cm. Since the pore size and porosity of bone tissue scaffolds have an important impact on the growth of bone scaffolds, cell adsorption, and waste discharge, previous studies have shown that the pore size of bone tissue scaffolds should be between 300 and 500 \u03bcm, and the porosity should be 50 % or above. In addition to the advantages of curvature, the structure generated by the triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) method will be more active in cell differentiation due to its internal interconnectivity. In addition, compared with the typical regular network structure, the nodes of the TPMS structure are smoother, and the pore size changes continuously, which can effectively reduce the stress concentration at the interface with different pore sizes. These properties make TPMS structures suitable for the preparation of bone tissue scaffolds. Therefore, in this paper, TPMS scaffolds with different pore sizes (300 \u03bcm, 400 \u03bcm, 500 \u03bcm) and different porosity (50 %, 60 %, 70 %) were constructed and their properties were studied. Firstly, G-type TPMS cells with dimensions of 1 \xd7 1\xd7 1 mm and porosity of 50 %, 60 %, and 70 % were designed and obtain the theoretical values for the wall thickness and pore size of each cell, as shown in. Next, the scaling coefficient for the nine different structures are derived by dividing the target pore diameters of 300 \u03bcm, 400 \u03bcm, and 500 \u03bcm by the pore size of the cell. Similarly, the sizes of each structure are determined by multiplying the cell size (1 \xd7 1 \xd7 1 mm) by the corresponding scaling coefficient. These filling units are used to fill a 10 \xd7 10 \xd7 10 mm cube to create the scaffold model. The constitutive relation of piezoelectric materials shows the coupling relation between their electrical properties and mechanical properties, and the constitutive equation of piezoelectricity coupling is shown in : Where \u03c3 and \u03b5 are stress and strain, respectively, the relationship between the two depends on the elastic flexibility S and the piezoelectric coefficient d , which determines the electric displacement d and the electric field strength E under the unit stress. \u03bb represents the dielectric displacement per unit electric field. The average piezoelectric coefficient (d 31 , d 32 , d 33 ) is usually used to evaluate the piezoelectric effect, as shown in :  In addition, the piezoelectric properties of biomimetic bone tissue scaffolds can be evaluated by the output voltage, which is defined as shown in : Where \u03a8 is the electric potential of the bone tissue scaffold when it is deformed. However, the TPMS structure can significantly improve the connectivity of the bone tissue scaffolds between the ceramics through the structural advantages of interconnection, thereby improving the piezoelectric performance of the scaffolds. Firstly, the model with different porosity at 300 \u03bcm was simulated. A downward boundary load of 0.5 N along the Z-axis is applied to the top surface, the bottom surface is fixed, and the top surface is grounded. The analysis results show that when the same force is applied in the Z-axis direction, the displacement in the Z-axis direction increases from 2.24\xd710E^{\u22125} mm to 3.21\xd710E^{\u22125} mm with the increase of porosity. At the same time, the output of electric potential increases from 4.10 V to 7.25 V, indicating that under the same polarization condition and the same force, the structure with larger porosity is more prone to deformation and will output a higher voltage. The model with 50 % porosity and different pore sizes was simulated and its stress distribution, strain size and potential output size were calculated, as shown in. The analysis results show that when the same force is applied in the Z-axis direction, the displacement in the Z-axis direction increases from 2.24\xd710E^{\u22125} mm to 3.69\xd710E^{\u22125} mm with the increase of the pore size. At the same time, the output of electric potential increased first and then decreased from 4.10 V, 5.10 V and 4.24 V, respectively. When the pore size was 400 \u03bcm, the output voltage reached a maximum of 5.1 V, indicating that under the same polarization condition and the same force, the output voltage of the support increased first and then decreased. The biomimetic bone tissue scaffolds with different pore sizes and porosity were named 300-50, 300-60, 300-70, 400-50, 400-60, 400-70, 500-50, 500-60, and 500-70, respectively. All structures were designed as cubes with a side length of 10 mm, which were imported into the equipment for printing, respectively. The porosity from left to right in the figure is 50 %, 60 %, and 70 %, respectively. Following debinding, the samples were introduced into the sintering furnace, where decarbonization occurred at 600 \xb0C, followed by a 3-h dwell period at 1300 \xb0C. The sample obtained by sintering of BT/HA composite ceramic biomimetic bone tissue scaffold is shown in (d), (e) and (f). After sintering, the scaffolds were cut, and internal wall thickness was measured at 10 randomly selected locations using a caliper. In this experiment, the axial compression test was performed on the fabricated BT/HA composite ceramic biomimetic bone tissue scaffold ceramic lattice structure. (a) shows the compressive strength of BT/HA composite ceramics with different pore sizes and different porosity. The compressive strength of BT/HA composite ceramics with 50 %, 60 % and 70 % porosity of 300 \u03bcm pore size was 2.63 MPa, 1.77 MPa and 1.67 MPa, respectively. Under the same pore size and different porosity structure, the mechanical properties of BT/HA composite ceramics decreased significantly with the increase of porosity. The compressive strength of BT/HA composite ceramics with 300 \u03bcm, 400 \u03bcm and 500 \u03bcm pore sizes at 50 % porosity is 2.63 MPa, 2.90 MPa and 4.26 MPa, respectively. In general, the porosity had a great effect on the mechanical properties of BT/HA composite ceramics. With the increase of porosity, the mechanical properties of BT/HA composite ceramics decreased significantly. Pore size has little effect on the mechanical properties of BT/HA composite ceramics. With the increase of pore size, the mechanical properties of BT/HA composite ceramics show an upward trend. According to the previous test results of the electric hysteresis loop, the polarization electric field strength was set at 15 kV/cm to polarize BT/HA composite ceramic biomimetic bone tissue scaffolds with different pore sizes and porosity. Because the BT/HA composite ceramic biomimetic bone tissue scaffold height is 10 mm, the DC voltage of polarization is set to 15 kV, the polarization time is 30 min, and the polarization temperature is 60 \xb0C. The d 33 of the biomimetic bone tissue scaffold is shown in (b). It can be seen from the figure that d 33 ranges between 2 and 9 pC/N, which meets the requirements of cancellous bone electrical properties. Porosity has a great effect on the electrical properties of BT/HA composite ceramics. With the increase of porosity, the d 33 of BT/HA composite ceramics decreases significantly. The influence of pore size on the d 33 of the BT/HA composite ceramic is relatively minor compared to that of porosity. With the increase of pore size, the d 33 of the scaffold shows a decreasing trend.

# ABSTRACT
BaTiO3/Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 composite ceramic is an outstanding representative of piezoelectric biomaterials, with excellent biocompatibility and piezoelectric effect, and has potential applications in the field of bone tissue repair. In this work, vat photopolymerization 3D printing technology was used to fabricate triply periodic minimal surface structure BaTiO3/Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 composite ceramic bone tissue scaffolds with different pore sizes and porosity, and their mechanical and electrical properties were studied. First, the ceramic slurry configuration process was optimized to obtain a ceramic slurry with high solid content (45 vol%) and excellent rheological properties. The results show that when sintering at 1300 °C, the BaTiO3/Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 composite ceramic has the highest relative density (99.18 %), the highest compressive strength (44 MPa), large relative dielectric constant (379–389), and low dielectric loss. The polarization electric field strength of the BaTiO3/Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 composite ceramic was set to 15 kV/cm through the test of the hysteresis loop. The results show that as the porosity increases and the pore size decreases, the mechanical properties of the scaffold decrease significantly, and its compressive strength ranges between 1.67 and 4.26 MPa; as the porosity increases and the pore size increases, the piezoelectric coefficient (d

# INTRODUCTION
The emergence of bone repair materials injected new vitality to the treatment of clinical bone defects, and the continuous development of bone tissue engineering has brought new hope to patients  The research findings reveal that upon insertion into the human body, hydroxyapatite (Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2, HA) fosters osteoblast-mediated bone matrix formation on its surface, facilitating direct bone tissue growth. This is important evidence that HA has osteogenic ability. HA can also combine with new bone to form mineralization, and its performance is similar to the fracture healing phenomenon. Julius Wolff in 1892 came up with what came to be known as \u201cwolf's law\u201d, which s tated that bone itself would remodel its structure in response to external stress. Halperin et al.  studied the variation of the piezoelectric strain coefficient value of human tibia in the range of 7.7\u20138.7 pC/N. Barium titanate (BaTiO3, BT) piezoelectric ceramic is a biologically inert ceramic material with stable composition, non-toxic and non-distorting effects. To further enhance the biological activity of BT piezoelectric ceramics, a commonly used method is to combine HA with BT. BT/HA materials have garnered significant attention from scholars as well. Swain et al.  cultured macrophages in vitro using polarized BT/HA composite ceramics and found that polarized BT/HA composite ceramics have better immune compatibility and can be used in bone tissue engineering applications. Then Swain et al.  further studied BT/HA composite ceramics containing strontium and found that the polarized composite enhanced osteoblast growth while reducing the possibility of bacterial infection. Wu et al.  explored the biocompatibility of BT/HA composite ceramics with different content ratios and believed that the composition of BT/HA = 7/3 is more conducive to osteoblast proliferation. Tavangar et al.  used cold isostatic sintering to prepare BT/HA composite scaffolds and proved that the addition of BT enhanced the mechanical and electrical properties of HA, and more apatite was deposited on the surface of BT/HA scaffolds after soaking in SBF solution. Jiao et al.  studied the mechanical and electrical properties of BT/HA composites prepared by the hydrothermal method and found that its compressive strength was 67.32 MPa and its d 33 was 0.61 pC/N, closely resembling the 0.7 pC/N measurement found in human dry bone. Ozcelik et al.  used the powder metallurgy method to prepare BT/HA with different BT contents and tested its performance after sintering at different temperatures and atmospheres. It was found that BT/HA composites with BT concentration less than 95 wt% had no piezoelectric response, and composites containing BT could promote osteoblast adhesion better than pure HA. Senthilkumar et al.  used plasma spraying technology to coat BT/HA on stainless steel and found that the composite ceramic film containing BT could better promote the growth and biomineralization process of osteoblasts than samples with only HA. In the past decade, with the development of 3D printing technology in science, engineering and medicine, it is now possible to create new bone tissue scaffolds with customized shapes, good microstructure, mechanical strength, and biological properties. Mystiridou et al.  prepared the PLA/PCL/HA/BT scaffold by the 3D printing method of melt deposition and tested its piezoelectric and dielectric properties. The d 33 and dielectric constant of the scaffold were close to human bone. Polley et al.  used direct ink writing 3D printing technology to fabricate BT/HA composite ceramic scaffolds, which have good cytocompatibility and cell adhesion and have piezoelectric properties similar to those of human bone, with a piezoelectric constant of 3 pC/N. Chen et al.  used vat photopolymerization (VPP) technology to fabricate a BT/HA bone tissue scaffold with a d 33 of 2.15 pC/N. In vitro analyses revealed that, under LIPUS treatment, the BT/HA piezoelectric ceramic scaffold showed a pronounced ability to foster osteogenic differentiation of DPSCs. Xue et al.  used VPP technology to fabricate a BT/HA bone tissue scaffold, the scaffold shows excellent dielectric properties (518.7), biological properties, and a high piezoelectric sensing output voltage (8V). VPP technology has the characteristics of rapid forming speed, high precision, fast curing rate, low cost, and capability to form complex ceramic structures. At present, there remains insufficient discussion on the regulation in mechanical and electrical properties in BT/HA composite ceramic porous structure through configuration characteristic parameters. In this work, a BT/HA composite ceramic bone tissue scaffold body was fabricated using VPP technology. The impact of various sintering processes on the mechanical and electrical properties of BT/HA composite ceramics was systematically investigated. The polarization electric field strength of BT/HA composite ceramics was set through analyzing the electric hysteresis loop. Based on the research on obtaining high relative density BT/HA composite ceramics, BT/HA composite ceramics with different pore sizes and porosity were designed and their effects on electromechanical properties were simulated. A BT/HA porous structural bone tissue scaffold with tunable electromechanical properties was fabricated, and the correlation between pore size, porosity, and electromechanical properties of the scaffold was evaluated.

# CONCLUSION
In this paper, VPP 3D printing technology was used to combine the piezoelectric ceramic BT and the biological ceramic HA to fabricate BT/HA composite ceramics. The optimal sintering temperature was determined by sample shrinkage test, relative density test, XRD analysis, SEM analysis, and other characterization methods. After sintering at 1300 \xb0C for 3 h, the compressive strength of the BT/HA composite ceramic can reach up to 44 MPa, and the relative density can reach up to 99.18 %. BT/HA composite ceramic has a stable tetragonal phase, HA is stably distributed on the BT surface, and the internal pores and defects of BT/HA composite ceramic are the least, and the grain size distribution is relatively uniform. The P r and Ec are 0.23 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} and 5.19 kV/cm, respectively, when the polarization electric field is 9 kV/cm, and the optimal polarization electric field strength is 15 kV/cm. By regulating the thickness and size of the single cell wall, the BT/HA bone tissue scaffold with three different pore sizes of 300 \u03bcm, 400 \u03bcm and 500 \u03bcm and three different porosity of 50 %, 60 % and 70 % was fabricated, and its mechanical and electrical properties were simulated and tested. The compressive strength ranged from 1.67 MPa to 4.26 MPa, which met the mechanical properties of cancellous bone. With the increase of porosity, the d 33 of the scaffold decreased significantly, and with the increase of pore size, the d 33 showed a decreasing trend. The d 33 ranges from 2 to 9 pC/N, which meets the electrical properties of cancellous bone. The above results indicate that this work provides a new idea for the application of customized BT/HA composite ceramic scaffolds in orthopedic implants.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Initially, the graded powder was fully mixed with resin monomer, photoinitiator and dispersant to obtain BT/HA ceramic slurry with 45 vol% solid content. Then, the BT/HA composite ceramic scaffold was fabricated by VPP 3D printing technology. Finally, the dense BT/HA composite ceramic scaffold was obtained by debinding and sintering treatment. (a) and (b) respectively show the morphology of the green body and the sintered sample. Debinding and sintering the ceramic green body is a key step for VPP 3D printing to form complex ceramic structures. So, before we decide on the atmosphere debinding process, TG-DSC tests were conducted for the BT/HA composite ceramic green body to find the decomposition temperature range of organic matter in it. (c) shows the TG-DSC-DTG curve of the ceramic green body, from which it can be seen that its thermal decomposition is mainly divided into the following three stages: The first stage is to heat up from room temperature to 200 \xb0C, and the weight loss is about 4.65 %. From 100 \xb0C, the DTG curve begins to show an obvious decline, and an obvious peak appears at about 175 \xb0C, indicating that the thermal decomposition rate is faster around this temperature. The DSC curve shows a peak of heat absorption at about 206 \xb0C. The second stage is about 200\u2013500 \xb0C, and the weight loss is about 20.53 %. Two obvious peaks appear in the DTG curve at about 416 \xb0C and 468 \xb0C, indicating that the thermal decomposition rate is fast at these two temperatures. The DSC curve also corresponds to the thermal absorption peak at about 426 \xb0C and 472 \xb0C. The third stage is about 500\u20131000 \xb0C, and the weight loss is about 2.31 %. The DTG curve is relatively stable at this stage, with no obvious peak, and the DSC curve has no obvious heat absorption peak, indicating that the resin has finished thermal decomposition at this stage. The temperature preservation process was set at 175 \xb0C, 416 \xb0C, and 468 \xb0C for 4 h under an argon atmosphere, and the heating rate was 0.5 \xb0C/min between 175 \xb0C and 468 \xb0C, and the other heating rate was 1 \xb0C/min. After debinding in the argon atmosphere, the temperature was first raised to 600 \xb0C at a temperature rate of 2 \xb0C/min, and the decarbonization was carried out under air for 2h. Then, the temperature was continued to 1200 \xb0C, 1250 \xb0C, 1300 \xb0C, 1350 \xb0C, and 1400 \xb0C for sintering for 3 h and subsequent tests were conducted thereafter. The density of the BT/HA composite ceramic sample was measured by the Hydrostatic weighing, and the theoretical density of the BT/HA composite ceramic was calculated to be 5.4288 g/cmE^{3}. The relative density of the BT/HA composite ceramic at different sintering temperatures is shown in (a). It can be seen that when the sintering temperature is 1300 \xb0C, the relative density of BT/HA composite ceramics is relatively large, about 99.18 %, and when the sintering temperature is lower than 1300 \xb0C, the relative density of ceramics is less than 92 %, which attributed to insufficient growth of BT ceramic grains, resulting in heightened internal defects within the ceramics. When the sintering temperature reaches 1350 \xb0C, the relative density of BT/HA composite ceramics decreases to 96.98 %, which may be due to the decomposition of HA, leading to the decline of the overall relative density of BT/HA composite ceramics. When the sintering temperature reaches 1400 \xb0C, the relative density is about 96.91 %. When the sintering temperature rises above 1300 \xb0C, although the shrinkage of BT/HA composite ceramics is still increasing, the relative density of BT/HA composite ceramics begins to decrease to a certain extent. It can be seen that the influence of sintering temperature on BT/HA composite ceramics is very obvious, and sintering at a too-high temperature will reduce the relative density of BT/HA composite ceramics. In (b), the shrinkage rates of BT/HA composite ceramic samples in X, Y, and Z directions were tested at different sintering temperatures. As the sintering temperature rose from 1200 \xb0C to 1400 \xb0C, the shrinkage rates in the three directions continued to increase, indicating that the ceramics were constantly contracting. When the sintering temperature rises above 1300 \xb0C, although the shrinkage of BT/HA composite ceramics is still increasing, the relative density of BT/HA composite ceramics begins to decrease to a certain extent. It can be seen that the influence of sintering temperature on BT/HA composite ceramics is very obvious, and a too high sintering temperature will reduce the relative density of BT/HA composite ceramics. The crystal phase structure of a BT/HA composite ceramic can be analyzed by XRD. The test specimen is a 5 \xd7 5 \xd7 2 mmE^{3} cuboid BT/HA composite ceramic. The phase composition of BT/HA composite ceramics was investigated by XRD at 1200 \xb0C, 1250 \xb0C and 1300 \xb0C. demonstrates that HA reacted with BT (JCPDS 34\u20130129) at 1250 \xb0C, leading to the replacement of BaE^{2+} in the perovskite structure by CaE^{2+} and resulting in the formation of a CaTiO3 (JCPDS 75\u20132100) phase. CaTiO3 is known for its ability to promote cell differentiation and its high biological activity and biocompatibility. Additionally, the synthesis process also yielded a certain amount of (Ba0.70Ca0.30)TiO3 (JCPDS 81\u20131288) and Ba3(PO4)2 (JCPDS 25\u20130028) phases. The released PO4 E^{3\u2212} ions form bioapatite precipitation on the surface of the bioceramics, facilitating new bone growth. Consequently, the formation of CaTiO3 and Ba3(PO4)2 phases during the sintering process enhances the biocompatibility and degradation rate of the BT/HA composite ceramics, potentially benefiting bone repair applications. As depicted in , the characteristic diffraction peaks of the (002) and (200) crystal faces exhibit splitting into 45\xb0 wide peaks, indicative of a tetragonal structure for the prepared BT ceramics. The spontaneous polarization associated with the tetragonal phase of BT demonstrates favorable ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties, which contribute positively to the piezoelectric characteristics of the BT/HA composite ceramics. Therefore, the following experiments were conducted to test and analyze the performance of BT/HA composite ceramics sintered at 1250 \xb0C, 1300 \xb0C, and 1350 \xb0C. As shown in (a), (b), and (c) in the figure are Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) micrographs of BT/HA composite ceramics held at 1250 \xb0C, 1300 \xb0C and 1350 \xb0C for 3 h, respectively. (d), (e), and (f) represent magnified views of the corresponding areas in (a), (b), and (c), respectively. It can be seen from the figure that at the sintering temperature of 1250 \xb0C, BT/HA composite ceramics are not dense enough, and there are more pores and holes, which may be because the BT grains cannot be fully grown at 1250 \xb0C, thus reducing the performance of BT/HA composite ceramics, which is consistent with the relative density results of previous tests. When the sintering temperature increased to 1300 \xb0C, the ceramic grains grew further and fewer pores than samples at other temperatures. When the sintering temperature was increased to 1350 \xb0C, the grains grew abnormally. The micromorphology of BT/HA composite ceramics sintered at 1300 \xb0C was further analyzed, as shown in. It can be seen from the figure that the microstructure of the BT/HA composite ceramic sample is dense. According to EDS analysis, BT is enclosed within the red circle frame, while HA is enclosed within the yellow circle frame, and the two are closely combined. In the experiment, the 3D-printed BT/HA composite ceramics were subjected to an axial compression test, and the stress-strain curve obtained is shown in (a). When the stress reaches the maximum value, the ceramic brittle fracture occurs, the stress of BT/HA composite ceramics decreases linearly and disappears, and the whole test process ends. The maximum compressive strength of BT/HA composite ceramics sintered at 1300 \xb0C is about 44 MPa. This is consistent with the results obtained by XRD analysis and SEM observation above. We additionally conducted flexural strength tests on BT/HA composite ceramics, and the result showed that the flexural strength of BT/HA composite ceramics sintered at 1300 \xb0C stands at approximately 30 MPa. The greater the d 33 , the stronger the response capability of the material to mechanical stress. The change of relative dielectric constant of BT/HA composite ceramics with frequency at different sintering temperatures is shown in (b). With the increase in frequency, the relative dielectric constant of BT/HA composite ceramics decreases continuously. However, the relative dielectric constant of BT/HA composite ceramics obtained at 1300 \xb0C is significantly higher than that at the other two sintering temperatures, and its relative dielectric constant is between 379 and 389. The change of dielectric loss of BT/HA composite ceramics with frequency at different sintering temperatures is shown in (c). With the increase of frequency, the dielectric loss of BT/HA composite ceramics first decreases and then increases, reaching the lowest value at about 500 kHz, but the dielectric loss of BT/HA composite ceramics sintered at 1300 \xb0C is generally lower than the other two temperatures. The hysteresis loops of BT/HA composite ceramics sintered at 1300 \xb0C under different electric field strengths are shown in (d). The strength of the polarized electric field depends on the coercive field (Ec) of piezoelectric ceramics, and the general polarized electric field is at least 2\u20133 times greater than the Ec. It can be seen from (d) that when the polarization electric field is 9 kV/cm, the remnant polarization (P r ) is 0.23 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}, and the Ec is 5.19 kV/cm. Therefore, the range of the polarization electric field strength can be set as 15 kV/cm. Since the pore size and porosity of bone tissue scaffolds have an important impact on the growth of bone scaffolds, cell adsorption, and waste discharge, previous studies have shown that the pore size of bone tissue scaffolds should be between 300 and 500 \u03bcm, and the porosity should be 50 % or above. In addition to the advantages of curvature, the structure generated by the triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) method will be more active in cell differentiation due to its internal interconnectivity. In addition, compared with the typical regular network structure, the nodes of the TPMS structure are smoother, and the pore size changes continuously, which can effectively reduce the stress concentration at the interface with different pore sizes. These properties make TPMS structures suitable for the preparation of bone tissue scaffolds. Therefore, in this paper, TPMS scaffolds with different pore sizes (300 \u03bcm, 400 \u03bcm, 500 \u03bcm) and different porosity (50 %, 60 %, 70 %) were constructed and their properties were studied. Firstly, G-type TPMS cells with dimensions of 1 \xd7 1\xd7 1 mm and porosity of 50 %, 60 %, and 70 % were designed and obtain the theoretical values for the wall thickness and pore size of each cell, as shown in. Next, the scaling coefficient for the nine different structures are derived by dividing the target pore diameters of 300 \u03bcm, 400 \u03bcm, and 500 \u03bcm by the pore size of the cell. Similarly, the sizes of each structure are determined by multiplying the cell size (1 \xd7 1 \xd7 1 mm) by the corresponding scaling coefficient. These filling units are used to fill a 10 \xd7 10 \xd7 10 mm cube to create the scaffold model. The constitutive relation of piezoelectric materials shows the coupling relation between their electrical properties and mechanical properties, and the constitutive equation of piezoelectricity coupling is shown in : Where \u03c3 and \u03b5 are stress and strain, respectively, the relationship between the two depends on the elastic flexibility S and the piezoelectric coefficient d , which determines the electric displacement d and the electric field strength E under the unit stress. \u03bb represents the dielectric displacement per unit electric field. The average piezoelectric coefficient (d 31 , d 32 , d 33 ) is usually used to evaluate the piezoelectric effect, as shown in :  In addition, the piezoelectric properties of biomimetic bone tissue scaffolds can be evaluated by the output voltage, which is defined as shown in : Where \u03a8 is the electric potential of the bone tissue scaffold when it is deformed. However, the TPMS structure can significantly improve the connectivity of the bone tissue scaffolds between the ceramics through the structural advantages of interconnection, thereby improving the piezoelectric performance of the scaffolds. Firstly, the model with different porosity at 300 \u03bcm was simulated. A downward boundary load of 0.5 N along the Z-axis is applied to the top surface, the bottom surface is fixed, and the top surface is grounded. The analysis results show that when the same force is applied in the Z-axis direction, the displacement in the Z-axis direction increases from 2.24\xd710E^{\u22125} mm to 3.21\xd710E^{\u22125} mm with the increase of porosity. At the same time, the output of electric potential increases from 4.10 V to 7.25 V, indicating that under the same polarization condition and the same force, the structure with larger porosity is more prone to deformation and will output a higher voltage. The model with 50 % porosity and different pore sizes was simulated and its stress distribution, strain size and potential output size were calculated, as shown in. The analysis results show that when the same force is applied in the Z-axis direction, the displacement in the Z-axis direction increases from 2.24\xd710E^{\u22125} mm to 3.69\xd710E^{\u22125} mm with the increase of the pore size. At the same time, the output of electric potential increased first and then decreased from 4.10 V, 5.10 V and 4.24 V, respectively. When the pore size was 400 \u03bcm, the output voltage reached a maximum of 5.1 V, indicating that under the same polarization condition and the same force, the output voltage of the support increased first and then decreased. The biomimetic bone tissue scaffolds with different pore sizes and porosity were named 300-50, 300-60, 300-70, 400-50, 400-60, 400-70, 500-50, 500-60, and 500-70, respectively. All structures were designed as cubes with a side length of 10 mm, which were imported into the equipment for printing, respectively. The porosity from left to right in the figure is 50 %, 60 %, and 70 %, respectively. Following debinding, the samples were introduced into the sintering furnace, where decarbonization occurred at 600 \xb0C, followed by a 3-h dwell period at 1300 \xb0C. The sample obtained by sintering of BT/HA composite ceramic biomimetic bone tissue scaffold is shown in (d), (e) and (f). After sintering, the scaffolds were cut, and internal wall thickness was measured at 10 randomly selected locations using a caliper. In this experiment, the axial compression test was performed on the fabricated BT/HA composite ceramic biomimetic bone tissue scaffold ceramic lattice structure. (a) shows the compressive strength of BT/HA composite ceramics with different pore sizes and different porosity. The compressive strength of BT/HA composite ceramics with 50 %, 60 % and 70 % porosity of 300 \u03bcm pore size was 2.63 MPa, 1.77 MPa and 1.67 MPa, respectively. Under the same pore size and different porosity structure, the mechanical properties of BT/HA composite ceramics decreased significantly with the increase of porosity. The compressive strength of BT/HA composite ceramics with 300 \u03bcm, 400 \u03bcm and 500 \u03bcm pore sizes at 50 % porosity is 2.63 MPa, 2.90 MPa and 4.26 MPa, respectively. In general, the porosity had a great effect on the mechanical properties of BT/HA composite ceramics. With the increase of porosity, the mechanical properties of BT/HA composite ceramics decreased significantly. Pore size has little effect on the mechanical properties of BT/HA composite ceramics. With the increase of pore size, the mechanical properties of BT/HA composite ceramics show an upward trend. According to the previous test results of the electric hysteresis loop, the polarization electric field strength was set at 15 kV/cm to polarize BT/HA composite ceramic biomimetic bone tissue scaffolds with different pore sizes and porosity. Because the BT/HA composite ceramic biomimetic bone tissue scaffold height is 10 mm, the DC voltage of polarization is set to 15 kV, the polarization time is 30 min, and the polarization temperature is 60 \xb0C. The d 33 of the biomimetic bone tissue scaffold is shown in (b). It can be seen from the figure that d 33 ranges between 2 and 9 pC/N, which meets the requirements of cancellous bone electrical properties. Porosity has a great effect on the electrical properties of BT/HA composite ceramics. With the increase of porosity, the d 33 of BT/HA composite ceramics decreases significantly. The influence of pore size on the d 33 of the BT/HA composite ceramic is relatively minor compared to that of porosity. With the increase of pore size, the d 33 of the scaffold shows a decreasing trend.

# ABSTRACT
BaTiO3/Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 composite ceramic is an outstanding representative of piezoelectric biomaterials, with excellent biocompatibility and piezoelectric effect, and has potential applications in the field of bone tissue repair. In this work, vat photopolymerization 3D printing technology was used to fabricate triply periodic minimal surface structure BaTiO3/Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 composite ceramic bone tissue scaffolds with different pore sizes and porosity, and their mechanical and electrical properties were studied. First, the ceramic slurry configuration process was optimized to obtain a ceramic slurry with high solid content (45 vol%) and excellent rheological properties. The results show that when sintering at 1300 °C, the BaTiO3/Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 composite ceramic has the highest relative density (99.18 %), the highest compressive strength (44 MPa), large relative dielectric constant (379–389), and low dielectric loss. The polarization electric field strength of the BaTiO3/Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 composite ceramic was set to 15 kV/cm through the test of the hysteresis loop.

# INTRODUCTION
The emergence of bone repair materials injected new vitality to the treatment of clinical bone defects, and the continuous development of bone tissue engineering has brought new hope to patients  The research findings reveal that upon insertion into the human body, hydroxyapatite (Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2, HA) fosters osteoblast-mediated bone matrix formation on its surface, facilitating direct bone tissue growth. This is important evidence that HA has osteogenic ability. HA can also combine with new bone to form mineralization, and its performance is similar to the fracture healing phenomenon. Julius Wolff in 1892 came up with what came to be known as \u201cwolf's law\u201d, which s tated that bone itself would remodel its structure in response to external stress. Halperin et al.  studied the variation of the piezoelectric strain coefficient value of human tibia in the range of 7.7\u20138.7 pC/N. Barium titanate (BaTiO3, BT) piezoelectric ceramic is a biologically inert ceramic material with stable composition, non-toxic and non-distorting effects. To further enhance the biological activity of BT piezoelectric ceramics, a commonly used method is to combine HA with BT. BT/HA materials have garnered significant attention from scholars as well. Swain et al.  cultured macrophages in vitro using polarized BT/HA composite ceramics and found that polarized BT/HA composite ceramics have better immune compatibility and can be used in bone tissue engineering applications. Then Swain et al.  further studied BT/HA composite ceramics containing strontium and found that the polarized composite enhanced osteoblast growth while reducing the possibility of bacterial infection. Wu et al.  explored the biocompatibility of BT/HA composite ceramics with different content ratios and believed that the composition of BT/HA = 7/3 is more conducive to osteoblast proliferation. Tavangar et al.  used cold isostatic sintering to prepare BT/HA composite scaffolds and proved that the addition of BT enhanced the mechanical and electrical properties of HA, and more apatite was deposited on the surface of BT/HA scaffolds after soaking in SBF solution. Jiao et al.  studied the mechanical and electrical properties of BT/HA composites prepared by the hydrothermal method and found that its compressive strength was 67.32 MPa and its d 33 was 0.61 pC/N, closely resembling the 0.7 pC/N measurement found in human dry bone. Ozcelik et al.  used the powder metallurgy method to prepare BT/HA with different BT contents and tested its performance after sintering at different temperatures and atmospheres. It was found that BT/HA composites with BT concentration less than 95 wt% had no piezoelectric response, and composites containing BT could promote osteoblast adhesion better than pure HA. Senthilkumar et al.  used plasma spraying technology to coat BT/HA on stainless steel and found that the composite ceramic film containing BT could better promote the growth and biomineralization process of osteoblasts than samples with only HA. In the past decade, with the development of 3D printing technology in science, engineering and medicine, it is now possible to create new bone tissue scaffolds with customized shapes, good microstructure, mechanical strength, and biological properties. Mystiridou et al.  prepared the PLA/PCL/HA/BT scaffold by the 3D printing method of melt deposition and tested its piezoelectric and dielectric properties. The d 33 and dielectric constant of the scaffold were close to human bone. Polley et al.  used direct ink writing 3D printing technology to fabricate BT/HA composite ceramic scaffolds, which have good cytocompatibility and cell adhesion and have piezoelectric properties similar to those of human bone, with a piezoelectric constant of 3 pC/N. Chen et al.  used vat photopolymerization (VPP) technology to fabricate a BT/HA bone tissue scaffold with a d 33 of 2.15 pC/N. In vitro analyses revealed that, under LIPUS treatment, the BT/HA piezoelectric ceramic scaffold showed a pronounced ability to foster osteogenic differentiation of DPSCs. Xue et al.  used VPP technology to fabricate a BT/HA bone tissue scaffold, the scaffold shows excellent dielectric properties (518.7), biological properties, and a high piezoelectric sensing output voltage (8V). VPP technology has the characteristics of rapid forming speed, high precision, fast curing rate, low cost, and capability to form complex ceramic structures. At present, there remains insufficient discussion on the regulation in mechanical and electrical properties in BT/HA composite ceramic porous structure through configuration characteristic parameters. In this work, a BT/HA composite ceramic bone tissue scaffold body was fabricated using VPP technology. The impact of various sintering processes on the mechanical and electrical properties of BT/HA composite ceramics was systematically investigated. The polarization electric field strength of BT/HA composite ceramics was set through analyzing the electric hysteresis loop. Based on the research on obtaining high relative density BT/HA composite ceramics, BT/HA composite ceramics with different pore sizes and porosity were designed and their effects on electromechanical properties were simulated. A BT/HA porous structural bone tissue scaffold with tunable electromechanical properties was fabricated, and the correlation between pore size, porosity, and electromechanical properties of the scaffold was evaluated.

# CONCLUSION
In this paper, VPP 3D printing technology was used to combine the piezoelectric ceramic BT and the biological ceramic HA to fabricate BT/HA composite ceramics. The optimal sintering temperature was determined by sample shrinkage test, relative density test, XRD analysis, SEM analysis, and other characterization methods. After sintering at 1300 \xb0C for 3 h, the compressive strength of the BT/HA composite ceramic can reach up to 44 MPa, and the relative density can reach up to 99.18 %. BT/HA composite ceramic has a stable tetragonal phase, HA is stably distributed on the BT surface, and the internal pores and defects of BT/HA composite ceramic are the least, and the grain size distribution is relatively uniform. The P r and Ec are 0.23 \u03bcC/cmE^{2} and 5.19 kV/cm, respectively, when the polarization electric field is 9 kV/cm, and the optimal polarization electric field strength is 15 kV/cm. By regulating the thickness and size of the single cell wall, the BT/HA bone tissue scaffold with three different pore sizes of 300 \u03bcm, 400 \u03bcm and 500 \u03bcm and three different porosity of 50 %, 60 % and 70 % was fabricated, and its mechanical and electrical properties were simulated and tested. The compressive strength ranged from 1.67 MPa to 4.26 MPa, which met the mechanical properties of cancellous bone. With the increase of porosity, the d 33 of the scaffold decreased significantly, and with the increase of pore size, the d 33 showed a decreasing trend. The d 33 ranges from 2 to 9 pC/N, which meets the electrical properties of cancellous bone. The above results indicate that this work provides a new idea for the application of customized BT/HA composite ceramic scaffolds in orthopedic implants.

**Notes**:
- Write complete chemical formulas (e.g. '(Use the abbreviation key-value pair to track the abbreviations while extracting composition-property keywords). Don't use abbreviations, but you can use different environment if multiple compositions have different d33 values in different environments. For e.g.: 'LiNbO3-Air' and 'LiNbO3-Vacuum'.
- If multiple compositions are mentioned with different d33 values, extract all compositions mentioning different type/environment with a '-' and coreresponding d33 values.
- Mos of the formula are provided in ABSTRACT or INTRODUCTION or first part of EXPERIMENTAL SYNTHESIS.
- Use element symbols (e.g. 'K' not 'Potassium')
- For compositions with variables:
   * If multiple d33 values exist: Extract all compositions by substituting each variable value
   * If single d33 value: Extract only the best composition
- Prioritize data from tables
- Preserve proper chemical notation including:
   * Subscripts for atom counts
   * Parentheses for grouped elements
   * Proper fraction formatting
- Include the measurement unit for d33 values (usually pC/N or pm/V)
- Identify the broader family/class of materials - can be abbreviated forms
- Include if there is any doping in the composition using '+' sign with the composition, e.g. 'LiNbO3 + 2%wt Mg'
- Don't remove brackets or parentheses from the chemical formula which is already in the composition. Also, sometimes fractions are written before the composition (mostly in ()) for composition mixtures, don't remove them.
- Don't modify the abbreviation from referenced papers unless full composition is not available.
- ALWAYS follow the asked JSON format. DON'T write any extra information such as note points or explanations.
