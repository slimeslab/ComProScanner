# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
BST-BZT is a solid solution of BaTiO3-BaZrO3-SrTiO3. In this particular composition, the parent compound is BaTiO3. Ba(Ti0.8Zr0.2)O3-(Ba0.7 Ca0.3)TiO3 (BZT-BCT). In their study they found that BZT-BCT showed enhanced piezoelectric properties (d33\u223c600 pC/N). displays the XRD pattern in the 2\u03b8 range from 15\xb0 \u221275\xb0 for the BST-BZT. The observed peaks are in accordance with previously reported tetragonal BaTiO3 ceramics (JCPDS No: 00-005-0626). This confirms that Strontium (Sr) and Zirconium (Zr) were successfully doped into BaTiO3 ceramics, and no impurities were detected in the synthesized BST-BZT powder. At 45\xb0 splitting of peaks is observed in the Bragg's planes (002) and (200), however the intensity of (200) plane is higher which suggests that there are strong chances that BST-BZT is crystalized in the tetragonal phase. presents the Raman spectrum in the range of 150\u2013950 cmE^{\u22121}(wavenumber). At wavenumbers of approximately 247, 301, 508, and 716 cmE^{\u22121}, dominating peaks were noted. There is a dip at about 180 cmE^{\u22121}, which is caused by the anti-symmetry mode A1(TO2). Additionally, the transverse optical modes are responsible for the A1 symmetry at \u223c255 cmE^{\u22121} and \u223c508 cmE^{\u22121}. Further, the B1 mode at \u223c301 cmE^{\u22121}, and the A1(LO3)E(LO) mode at \u223c716 cmE^{\u22121} may suggest the presence of the tetragonal phase in a BST-BZT composition. XRD and Raman spectrum confirm that there is a strong possibility that the material is crystalized in the tetragonal phase. displays the surface morphology of the sample in pellet form, at a scale of 5 \u03bcm and1\u03bcm. The BST-BZT composition's morphology reveals irregularly shaped particles. The XPS spectrum was utilized to ascertain the BST-BZT chemical composition. exhibits the XPS survey, binding energy in the range of 0\u20131200 eV of the BST-BZT sample, indicating the presence of Ba, Zr, Sr, Ti, and O. The Ba XPS analysis depicted in (b) indicates that the Ba3d3/2 and Ba3d5/2 peaks can be fitted with a separation of approximately 1.5 eV. The binding energies around \u223c793.28 eV and \u223c777.97 eV are attributed to Ba atoms, while the peaks at \u223c779.28 eV and \u223c794.94 eV are related to Ba atoms formed amid decayed barium carbonate layers. Moreover, the Sr3d peaks can be resolved at approximately \u223c132.5 eV and \u223c134.2 eV, as illustrated in (c). The peaks observed at \u223c176.3 eV and \u223c177.8 eV correspond to the two spin-orbit peaks of Zr i. e 3d5/2 and 3d3/2. The peaks shown in at \u223c457.62 eV and \u223c463.41 eV are attributed to the Ti2p3/2 and Ti2p1/2 core levels with TiE^{4+} cations. Displays the BST-BZT powder sample's absorbance spectrum across a 200\u2013800 nm wavelength range. The powder sample gradually increases its absorbance in the 415\u2013550 nm wavelength range, but it absorbs significantly less energy in the 500\u2013800 nm wavelength range. The greatest absorption of light up to a wavelength of 200 nm is revealed by a sharp rise in absorption after 415 nm. Additionally, using Tauc's relation, the energy band gap of the synthesized BST-BZT composition was determined. As seen in , the band gap of 3.19 eV was estimated in BST-BZT using Tauc plot using Equation. where " B " stands for energy independent coefficient, " \u03b1 " for the absorption coefficient, and " Eg" for the synthesized sample's energy band gap. Plank's constant is " h," light frequency is " \u03bd," and " m" is the kind of electronic transition responsible for optical absorption." m" can be interpreted as 1/2 for the direct and 2 for the indirect energy band gap depending upon material's properties. shows the MB dye's absorbance spectra obtained by the piezocatalysis process. For the piezocatalysis experiment two different type of dyes methylene blue (MB) and rhodamine B (RhB) were taken of 10 ppm (10mglE^{\u22121}) concentration of 10 ml volume initially. Firstly, all the piezocatalysis experiments were done on MB dye and after that RhB dye was taken to further examine the catalytic performance of material. The samples were kept on magnetic stirrer for overnight so that they complete their adsorption and once they reached their adsorption-desorption equilibrium samples were underwent piezocatalysis. represents degradation of MB dye through piezocatalysis process using pellets of BST-BZT without any electrode conditions. Total \u223c34 % degradation was observed in piezocatalysis by pellets (BST-BZT) in 4 h, while readings were taken at an interval of 30 min. represents the degradation of MB dye through piezocatalysis process using a BST-BZT pellet with silver as an electrode. The total degradation observed was \u223c68 % which is around \u223c34 % more than the pellets without electrodes. represents C/C 0 vs. time plots, illustrating the degradation of MB dye in the piezocatalysis process, comparing controlled, without electrode, and with electrode conditions. depicts the kinetic performance analysis of MB dye under different conditions. From kinetic analysis it can be seen that k value (0.00434 minE^{\u22121}) is maximum for with electrode condition showing that it has maximum degradation capability than that of the without electrode pellets. For the experiments 10 ppm dye of 10 ml was used, and after achieving adsorption equilibrium experiments were performed. In RhB dye total degradation of \u223c36 % and \u223c75 % was observed for pellet without electrode and with electrode represented in respectively. shows a C/C 0 vs. time plots illustrating the degradation of RhB dye under the piezocatalysis process in three conditions: control, without electrode, and with electrode. evaluates the kinetic performance of RhB dye under these conditions, highlighting the influence of the electrode on piezocatalytic activity. The kinetic analysis reveals that the k value (0.00543 minE^{\u22121}) is highest for the with electrode condition, indicating it has the greatest degradation capability compared to the without electrode pellets. The degradation observed in electrode effect for BST-BZT is may be due to the pellets having silver coating acting as a Schottky junction. This, in turn, reduces the activation energy and formation of ROS such as \u2022O2 E^{\u2212} and hE^{+} will be more. Thus, the enhancement reported in silver-pasted electrode is due to the improved efficiency of carrier separation leading to higher yield of ROS generation. Yang et al. in one of their studies proposed that during ultrasonication when stresses are applied in a direction to perpendicular to Schottky junction, because of the positive electrostriction coefficient (Q11) the semiconductor's dielectric permittivity will rise. Along with Schottky junction formation resulting in enhanced electric polarization and band gap tilting another possible mechanism for degradation in pellets of BST-BZT without any electrode condition is piezocatalysis because of non-centrosymmetric nature of BST-BZT. Sometimes this high frequency waves cause localized temperature of 5000K and pressure over 1000 atm, results in sonocatalysis of dye. During piezocatalysis, the charge separates into negative free electrons and positive holes on the BST-BZT sample's surface, actively participating in the redox reactions. In this phenomenon, adsorbed O2 and OHE^{\u2212} undergo reduction and oxidation processes, resulting in the formation of \u2022OH and \u2022O2 E^{\u2212}. The reactions involved during piezocatalysis are as follows :  In order to examine effect of poling, Corona poling was also done on BST-BZT pellets having with electrodes and without electrodes. shows the schematic representation of setup used for Corona poling. To examine the piezocatalytic activity of these samples they were putted in 10 ml solution of MB dye having 10 ppm concentration. and (c) shows the absorbance spectra of these poled samples without and with electrode conditions respectively. shows the percentage degradation of MB dye resulting from the effect of electrode presence and absence in Corona poling. The total degradation was observed in poled pellet without electrode was \u223c34 % and in poled pellet with electrode effect shown \u223c78 % degradation. The degradation observed in the poled electrode pallet is 78 %, while in unpoled electrode effect pallet 68 % degradation was observed. So, this difference of 10 % degradation of MB dye in the poled electrode effect is may due to the triboelectric effect and surface polarization. Further, parametric study was performed on MB dye by changing the various initial concentrations of dye solutions 5 ppm, 10, 15 and 20 ppm. The degradation of MB dye achieved was \u223c80 %, \u223c68 %, \u223c57 % and \u223c44 % for 5 ppm, 10 ppm, 15 ppm and 20 ppm dye respectively. 0 (a) represents the C/C0 plots of various dye concentration and 0 (b) represents the result for kinetic rate of various dye concentration. While 0 (c) represents the fitted value of rate constants and it can be observed that highest rate constant is shown by the 5 ppm initial concentration dye which is 0.0059 minE^{\u22121}. Indicating that highest degradation can be achieved in 5 ppm dye than the others. A high degradation rate of \u223c80 % was achieved for 5 ppm MB after 4 h of ultrasound treatment, while in 20 ppm degradation was \u223c44 %. The possible reason for this phenomenon is, adsorption of MB molecules on the catalyst's active sites can weaken the internal piezoelectric field, thereby reducing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). As the production of ROS reduces the capability of degradation also decreases. The rate constants were fitted to a straight line for different starting concentrations, resulting in an RE^{2} value of 0.987, defining the trend observed in piezocatalysis. The fitted linear equation (Eq. ) is visible in (c), where "k" represents the rate constant and "c" denotes the concentration of the MB dye aqueous solution. A parametric investigation was also carried out on MB dye, involving the alteration of dye solution volumes to 5 ml, 10 ml, 20 ml, and 30 ml. The degradation achieved was approximately \u223c75 %, \u223c68 %, \u223c51 %, and \u223c35 % for the respective volumes. 1 (a) shows the C/C0 plots for different dye volumes, and 1 (b) presents the kinetic rate results for these varying volumes. 1 (c) displays the fitted values of the rate constants fitted linearly, revealing that the highest rate constant of 0.00486 minE^{\u22121} was observed for the 5 ml dye volume. Indicating that the highest degradation is achieved within 5 ml dye solution. The fitted linear equation (Eq. ) is displayed in (c), where "k" represents the rate constant and "v" denotes the volume of the MB dye aqueous solution. The degradation rate is influenced by the volume of the MB dye solution, with larger volumes resulting in a lower rate constant when all other parameters remain constant. As the volume increases, the number of dye molecules also rises, this leads to degradation in adsorption capacity by reducing less ROS generation. In view of reusability of the sample, for all the parametric study same BST-BZT pellet was used and the results suggested that the sample can be used for several times in piezocatalysis. Among all the scavengers tested, the degradation obtained with the IPA scavenger was the least. 100 \u03bcL of EDTA, BQ, and IPA were introduced into 10 ml of MB dye, EDTA captures holes (hE^{+}), IPA captures hydroxyl radicals (\u2022OH), and BQ captures superoxide radicals (O2 E^{\u2212}). The degradation observed during scavenger was \u223c41 %, \u223c36 % and \u223c33 % for EDTA, BQ, and IPA respectively indicating that IPA was prime agent behind the degradation activity. Holes (hE^{+}) and electrons (eE^{\u2212}) are produced during the transition between the conduction band (CB) and the valence band (VB) due to ultrasonic high-energy vibrations. The surface charges initiate the formation of reactive species directly from water, including hydroxyl radicals (\u2022OH) and superoxide radicals (O2 E^{\u2212}). These reactive species are the cause for the degradation of MB dye via oxidation. Therefore, it can be concluded that hydroxyl radicals (\u2022OH) were the primary reactive species responsible for the degradation of 10 ml of MB dye via the piezocatalysis process using the electrode effect.

# ABSTRACT
In water remediation applications ferroelectric materials have been shown wide applicability in catalysis due to their spontaneous polarization. 0.5Ba(Zr0.2Ti0.8)O3 – 0.5(Ba0.7Sr0.3)TiO3 (BST-BZT) pellets were examined for piezocatalysis activity by electrode effect. X-ray diffraction, Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE SEM), and Raman spectroscopy were performed to confirm the phase, morphology and vibrational modes of prepared samples, respectively. Further, Diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) and X-Ray Photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was done to check absorbance and chemical composition. Piezocatalysis activity on electrode sample was observed under 150W and 40 kHz ultrasonication. Well dried samples showed enhanced dye degradation of 68 %.

# INTRODUCTION
There are large range of ferroelectric materials which includes BaTiO3 , LiNbO3 , Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 , Bi4Ti3O12  and many more solid solutions of the above. It was reported in number of materials such as Na0.5Bi0.5TiO 3 \u2013BaTiO3 , 0.92Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3\u20130.08BaTiO3. Another article by Zhang et al. claims flexoelectric like effect on the surface of BaTiO3 ceramics. Samples were examined under different conditions such as annealed sample, quenched sample, and polished BaTiO3 sample. In view of energy consumption catalysis is the process that requires less energy which is comparable to energy required to drive Internet of thing (IOT) devices etc. These charges act as free charge carriers in form of holes (hE^{+}) and electrons (eE^{\u2212}) and upon reacting with dyes (a symbolic organic pollutants) they generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). These ROS further produces free radicals such as hydroxides (\u2022OH) and super oxides (\u2022O2 E^{\u2212}). This study focuses unconventional strategy to improve piezocatalysis using interfacial polarization between electrodes and 0.5Ba(Zr0.2Ti0.8)O3 \u2013 0.5(Ba0.7Sr0.3)TiO3 (BST- BZT) pellets. BST- BZT is known lead -free ferroelectric ceramics.

# CONCLUSION
Using the solid-state reaction route process 0.5Ba(Zr0.2Ti0.8)O3 \u2013 0.5(Ba0.7Sr0.3)TiO3 (BST-BZT) composition was synthesized which is a ferroelectric ceramic. For piezocatalysis application with electrode effect and without electrode effect (MB and RhB dye) was studied. The degradation observed was \u223c34 % in without electrode and \u223c68 % with electrode in MB dye and \u223c35 % and \u223c75 % for RhB dye respectively. While parametric study was performed by varying the dye concentration (5,10,15,20 ppm) and highest degradation was noticed in 5 ppm MB dye with \u223c80 % degradation. By varying the volume quantity of MB dye (5, 10, 20,30 ml) highest degradation was achieved in 5 ml with \u223c75 % degradation. Further Corona poling was done to study its effect on electrode and sample with poled electrode showed \u223c78 % degradation showing significantly improved results than other samples including electrode and unpoled samples. The scavenger test revealed that the primary reactive species responsible for dye degradation were hydroxyl radicals (\u2022OH).

The degradation observed in electrode effect for BST-BZT is may be due to the pellets having silver coating acting as a Schottky junction. This, in turn, reduces the activation energy and formation of ROS such as \u2022O2 E^{\u2212} and hE^{+} will be more. Thus, the enhancement reported in silver-pasted electrode is due to the improved efficiency of carrier separation leading to higher yield of ROS generation. Yang et al. in one of their studies proposed that during ultrasonication when stresses are applied in a direction to perpendicular to Schottky junction, because of the positive electrostriction coefficient (Q11) the semiconductor's dielectric permittivity will rise. Along with Schottky junction formation resulting in enhanced electric polarization and band gap tilting another possible mechanism for degradation in pellets of BST-BZT without any electrode condition is piezocatalysis because of non-centrosymmetric nature of BST-BZT. Sometimes this high frequency waves cause localized temperature of 5000K and pressure over 1000 atm, results in sonocatalysis of dye. During piezocatalysis, the charge separates into negative free electrons and positive holes on the BST-BZT sample's surface, actively participating in the redox reactions. In this phenomenon, adsorbed O2 and OHE^{\u2212} undergo reduction and oxidation processes, resulting in the formation of \u2022OH and \u2022O2 E^{\u2212}. The reactions involved during piezocatalysis are as follows :  In order to examine effect of poling, Corona poling was also done on BST-BZT pellets having with electrodes and without electrodes. shows the schematic representation of setup used for Corona poling. To examine the piezocatalytic activity of these samples they were putted in 10 ml solution of MB dye having 10 ppm concentration. and (c) shows the absorbance spectra of these poled samples without and with electrode conditions respectively. shows the percentage degradation of MB dye resulting from the effect of electrode presence and absence in Corona poling. The total degradation was observed in poled pellet without electrode was \u223c34 % and in poled pellet with electrode effect shown \u223c78 % degradation. The degradation observed in the poled electrode pallet is 78 %, while in unpoled electrode effect pallet 68 % degradation was observed. So, this difference of 10 % degradation of MB dye in the poled electrode effect is may due to the triboelectric effect and surface polarization. Further, parametric study was performed on MB dye by changing the various initial concentrations of dye solutions 5 ppm, 10, 15 and 20 ppm. The degradation of MB dye achieved was \u223c80 %, \u223c68 %, \u223c57 % and \u223c44 % for 5 ppm, 10 ppm, 15 ppm and 20 ppm dye respectively. 0 (a) represents the C/C0 plots of various dye concentration and 0 (b) represents the result for kinetic rate of various dye concentration. While 0 (c) represents the fitted value of rate constants and it can be observed that highest rate constant is shown by the 5 ppm initial concentration dye which is 0.0059 minE^{\u22121}. Indicating that highest degradation can be achieved in 5 ppm dye than the others. A high degradation rate of \u223c80 % was achieved for 5 ppm MB after 4 h of ultrasound treatment, while in 20 ppm degradation was \u223c44 %. The possible reason for this phenomenon is, adsorption of MB molecules on the catalyst's active sites can weaken the internal piezoelectric field, thereby reducing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). As the production of ROS reduces the capability of degradation also decreases. The rate constants were fitted to a straight line for different starting concentrations, resulting in an RE^{2} value of 0.987, defining the trend observed in piezocatalysis. The fitted linear equation (Eq. ) is visible in (c), where "k" represents the rate constant and "c" denotes the concentration of the MB dye aqueous solution. A parametric investigation was also carried out on MB dye, involving the alteration of dye solution volumes to 5 ml, 10 ml, 20 ml, and 30 ml. The degradation achieved was approximately \u223c75 %, \u223c68 %, \u223c51 %, and \u223c35 % for the respective volumes. 1 (a) shows the C/C0 plots for different dye volumes, and 1 (b) presents the kinetic rate results for these varying volumes. 1 (c) displays the fitted values of the rate constants fitted linearly, revealing that the highest rate constant of 0.00486 minE^{\u22121} was observed for the 5 ml dye volume. Indicating that the highest degradation is achieved within 5 ml dye solution. The fitted linear equation (Eq. ) is displayed in (c), where "k" represents the rate constant and "v" denotes the volume of the MB dye aqueous solution. The degradation rate is influenced by the volume of the MB dye solution, with larger volumes resulting in a lower rate constant when all other parameters remain constant. As the volume increases, the number of dye molecules also rises, this leads to degradation in adsorption capacity by reducing less ROS generation. In view of reusability of the sample, for all the parametric study same BST-BZT pellet was used and the results suggested that the sample can be used for several times in piezocatalysis. Among all the scavengers tested, the degradation obtained with the IPA scavenger was the least. 100 \u03bcL of EDTA, BQ, and IPA were introduced into 10 ml of MB dye, EDTA captures holes (hE^{+}), IPA captures hydroxyl radicals (\u2022OH), and BQ captures superoxide radicals (O2 E^{\u2212}). The degradation observed during scavenger was \u223c41 %, \u223c36 % and \u223c33 % for EDTA, BQ, and IPA respectively indicating that IPA was prime agent behind the degradation activity. Holes (hE^{+}) and electrons (eE^{\u2212}) are produced during the transition between the conduction band (CB) and the valence band (VB) due to ultrasonic high-energy vibrations. The surface charges initiate the formation of reactive species directly from water, including hydroxyl radicals (\u2022OH) and superoxide radicals (O2 E^{\u2212}). These reactive species are the cause for the degradation of MB dye via oxidation. Therefore, it can be concluded that hydroxyl radicals (\u2022OH) were the primary reactive species responsible for the degradation of 10 ml of MB dye via the piezocatalysis process using the electrode effect.

# ABSTRACT
In water remediation applications ferroelectric materials have been shown wide applicability in catalysis due to their spontaneous polarization. 0.5Ba(Zr0.2Ti0.8)O3 – 0.5(Ba0.7Sr0.3)TiO3 (BST-BZT) pellets were examined for piezocatalysis activity by electrode effect. X-ray diffraction, Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE SEM), and Raman spectroscopy were performed to confirm the phase, morphology and vibrational modes of prepared samples, respectively. Further, Diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) and X-Ray Photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was done to check absorbance and chemical composition. Piezocatalysis activity on electrode sample was observed under 150W and 40 kHz ultrasonication. Well dried samples showed enhanced dye degradation of 68 %.

# INTRODUCTION
There are large range of ferroelectric materials which includes BaTiO3 , LiNbO3 , Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 , Bi4Ti3O12  and many more solid solutions of the above. It was reported in number of materials such as Na0.5Bi0.5TiO 3 \u2013BaTiO3 , 0.92Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3\u20130.08BaTiO3. Another article by Zhang et al. claims flexoelectric like effect on the surface of BaTiO3 ceramics. Samples were examined under different conditions such as annealed sample, quenched sample, and polished BaTiO3 sample. In view of energy consumption catalysis is the process that requires less energy which is comparable to energy required to drive Internet of thing (IOT) devices etc. These charges act as free charge carriers in form of holes (hE^{+}) and electrons (eE^{\u2212}) and upon reacting with dyes (a symbolic organic pollutants) they generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). These ROS further produces free radicals such as hydroxides (\u2022OH) and super oxides (\u2022O2 E^{\u2212}). This study focuses unconventional strategy to improve piezocatalysis using interfacial polarization between electrodes and 0.5Ba(Zr0.2Ti0.8)O3 \u2013 0.5(Ba0.7Sr0.3)TiO3 (BST- BZT) pellets. BST- BZT is known lead -free ferroelectric ceramics.

# CONCLUSION
Using the solid-state reaction route process 0.5Ba(Zr0.2Ti0.8)O3 \u2013 0.5(Ba0.7Sr0.3)TiO3 (BST-BZT) composition was synthesized which is a ferroelectric ceramic. For piezocatalysis application with electrode effect and without electrode effect (MB and RhB dye) was studied. The degradation observed was \u223c34 % in without electrode and \u223c68 % with electrode in MB dye and \u223c35 % and \u223c75 % for RhB dye respectively. While parametric study was performed by varying the dye concentration (5,10,15,20 ppm) and highest degradation was noticed in 5 ppm MB dye with \u223c80 % degradation. By varying the volume quantity of MB dye (5, 10, 20,30 ml) highest degradation was achieved in 5 ml with \u223c75 % degradation. Further Corona poling was done to study its effect on electrode and sample with poled electrode showed \u223c78 % degradation showing significantly improved results than other samples including electrode and unpoled samples. The scavenger test revealed that the primary reactive species responsible for dye degradation were hydroxyl radicals (\u2022OH).
