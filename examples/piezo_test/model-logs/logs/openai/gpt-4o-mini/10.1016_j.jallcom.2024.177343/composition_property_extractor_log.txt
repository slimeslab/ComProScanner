# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of the BTF-100xYb ceramics. All diffraction peaks are well indexed by the standard diffraction data , illustrating a single orthorhombic phase with the space group A21 am. No impurity phases were detected in any of the samples, implying that the ytterbium dopant ions were successfully incorporated into the pseudo-perovskite layers, presumably occupying the BiE^{3+} at A-site. According to Shannon\u2019s law , due to the difference in effective ionic radius of YbE^{3+} (115 pm, coordination number CN = 12) and BiE^{3+} (136 pm, CN = 12), the substitution of ytterbium results in a lattice distortion, which is responsible for the intrinsic contribution to the significant enhancement in piezoelectric properties of BTF. The strongest diffraction peak (119) of BTF is consistent with the crystal surface index (112 m +1), corresponding to the strongest diffraction peak of BLSFs. Compared with X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman scattering is not only more sensitive and efficient for investigating lattice vibration modes but also provides more detailed information related to the crystallographic positions of substitutional ions and their effects on ferroelectric behavior through the occurrence of extra modes and/or shifts in peak position. presents Raman scattering spectra with Raman shifts ranging from 50 to 1000 cmE^{\u22121} at room temperature. The first type includes modes with frequencies below 200 cmE^{\u22121}, which are associated with the vibrations of Bi atoms at the A-site. The second type includes modes with frequencies above 200 cmE^{\u22121}, related to the internal vibrations of oxygen octahedra in the perovskite-like layers. In the BTF ceramic samples, prominent Raman modes appear at around 100, 116, 142, 230, 261, 333, 539, 571, and 860 cmE^{\u22121}, indicating the formation of a well-defined four-layer perovskite structure. The low-frequency Raman modes near 100, 116, and 142 cmE^{\u22121} are closely related to the vibrations of BiE^{3+} ions at the A-site of the perovskite-like slabs. The high-frequency Raman modes around 230 and 261 cmE^{\u22121} correspond to the bending vibrations of the O-Ti/Fe-O bonds in the oxygen octahedron. Raman modes near 333 cmE^{\u22121} are associated with the combined twisting and stretching vibrations of the oxygen octahedron , while the modes around 539 and 571 cmE^{\u22121} are related to the relative vibrations of the oxygen atom at the top outer end of the (Ti/Fe)O6 octahedron. The high-frequency mode appearing around 860 cmE^{\u22121} corresponds to the tensile vibrations of the TiO6 octahedron along the c-axis. After the introduction of ytterbium ions, the characteristic peaks mentioned above remain evident, suggesting that the ytterbium substitution does not significantly alter the basic structure of BTF. Notably, the high-frequency Raman modes located near 230 and 333 cmE^{\u22121} are intensified compared to the BTF, indicating the effect of ytterbium substitution on the distortion of the (Ti/Fe)O6 octahedron. This also suggests that ytterbium ions tend to replace bismuth ions, affecting the local structural environment around the BO6 octahedron, including changes in the phonon vibration frequency of the outer oxygen atom at the top of the (Ti/Fe)O6 octahedron and a reduction in local structural symmetry. Additionally, the positions and intensities of other Raman peaks show little change, indicating they are not significantly affected by the ytterbium ion replacement of bismuth ions. shows scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of natural surfaces for BTF-100xYb ceramics. All ceramic samples exhibit a compact, pore-free microstructure, indicating optimal sintering conditions for BTF-100xYb ceramics. The grains in all samples are well-developed, laminar, and randomly oriented, characteristic of BLSF ceramics. Due to the high grain growth rate perpendicular to the c-axis of BLSF crystals, the grain growth is structurally anisotropic, with the length of the plate-like grains significantly exceeding their thickness. Compared to BTF, the ytterbium-substituted BTF ceramics exhibit larger grain sizes, which are advantageous for enhancing piezoelectric properties. The average grain size of BTF increases significantly with increasing ytterbium content, demonstrating that the substitution of ytterbium improves mass diffusion and accelerates the migration of ions during the sintering process , thus facilitating the grain growth. This observation is consistent with recent reports on other BLSF compounds. Ceramics with low electrical resistivity can generate high leakage currents, leading to charge drift and interference with the detection of charges induced by the piezoelectric effect. (a) shows the temperature dependence of the dc electrical resistivity of BTF-100xYb ceramics. As shown in , the maximum resistivity values are observed for BTF-4Yb, measuring 2.4\xd710E^{7} \u03a9 cm at 300 \xb0C, 1.6\xd710E^{6} \u03a9 cm at 400 \xb0C, and 1.8\xd710E^{5} \u03a9 cm at 500 \xb0C. These values are higher than those of BTF, which are 8.8\xd710E^{6} \u03a9 cm at 300 \u2103, 5.6\xd710E^{5} \u03a9 cm at 400 \u2103, and 6.7\xd710E^{4} \u03a9 cm at 500 \u2103. The high dc electrical resistivity allows ytterbium-substituted BTF ceramics to withstand higher electric fields, enhancing their piezoelectric properties through sufficient polarization. The (Bi2O2)E^{2+} layers play a crucial role in space-charge compensation in Aurivillius-type compounds, improving electrical properties by suppressing leakage currents. Bismuth ions tend to volatilize during high-temperature sintering due to its relatively low melting point (\u223c820 \xb0C), leading to the formation of oxygen vacancies that act as charge carriers. The substitution of the highly volatile bismuth ions with ytterbium ions, which have a higher melting point (\u223c2346 \xb0C), can effectively suppress bismuth loss during sintering. This stabilization of the (Bi2O2)E^{2+} layers reduced the formation of point defects such as oxygen vacancies. In Aurivillius-type materials, grain growth is structurally anisotropic, occurring primarily in the a-b plane, while the (Bi2O2)E^{2+} layers along the c-axis act as natural insulating media. Larger grain sizes in ytterbium-substituted ceramics facilitate long-range charge transport due to reduced grain boundary effects and weaker insulation by the (Bi2O2)E^{2+} layers. This explains why the resistivity decreases with increasing ytterbium substitution, particularly in BTF-20Yb. The temperature-dependent resistivity behavior follows the Arrhenius relationship : \u03c1 = \u03c1 0 exp (E a/k B T), where \u03c1 0 is a pre-exponential factor, E a is the activation energy, k B is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute temperature. An activation energy of \u223c0.90 eV, typical for the migration enthalpy of oxygen, suggests that the electrical conduction process in BTF-100xYb ceramics is dominated by the oxygen vacancies. shows the dielectric constant (\u03b5 r) and dielectric loss (tan\u03b4) of BTF-100xYb measured at 1 MHz. The \u03b5 r of all samples increases gradually as the temperature rises from room temperature (RT) to 500 \xb0C. However, it increases sharply above 500 \xb0C due to high electrical conductivity. All samples exhibit a distinct peak in \u03b5 r, corresponding to the ferroelectric-to-paraelectric phase transition, i.e., the T C of the material. Although only one phase transition is observed in BTF-100xYb, BTF-20Yb shows a small bump around 600 \xb0C, attributed to space charge effects, which is consistent with observations in Co-doped BTF. As indicated in the inset of (a) and , T C values significantly increase with ytterbium substitution, due to the distortion of the BTF lattice caused by the introduction of ytterbium ions. The optimal composition, BTF-4Yb, has a T C of 771 \xb0C, and the maximum T C of 805 \xb0C is achieved for BTF-20Yb, which is 42 \xb0C higher than that of unmodified BTF (763 \xb0C). Previous studies have shown that T C values in BLSFs are strongly related to the degree of structural distortion , described by the tolerance factor (t), defined as t= R A+ R O 2( R B+ R O), where R A , R B , and R O are the ionic radii of A-site cations, B-site cations, and oxygen ions, respectively. According to Shannon\u2019s law , compared with BiE^{3+} (136 pm, CN = 12) at the A-site, the substitution of YbE^{3+} (115 pm, CN = 12) with a smaller ionic radius at the A-site leads to a decrease in t and an increase in T C. Similarly, as shown in (b), the tan\u03b4 increases gradually up to 500 \xb0C but rises sharply above 500 \xb0C due to high conductivity and thermally activated domain wall movements. Research suggests that oxygen vacancies (Vo..) resulting from bismuth volatilization during the calcination process act as space charges, leading to the domain pinning effect and increased tan\u03b4. However, the dielectric loss of BTF-4Yb ceramics is lower than 0.03 below 300 \xb0C, which is conducive to its application in high temperature scenarios. Benefitting from the slight lattice distortion, increased grain size, and reduced oxygen vacancy concentration induced by the introduction of ytterbium, the piezoelectric and electromechanical properties of BTF-100xYb ceramics are significantly improved. As listed in , the piezoelectric constant d 33 is prominently improved and shows a trend of first increasing and then decreasing with the increasing ytterbium substitution. The optimal piezoelectric performance with a maximum d 33 value of 21.4 pC/N is achieved by BTF-4Yb, which is more than three times that of the unmodified BTF of 7.1 pC/N. In addition, an enhanced planar frequency constant (N p) of 2096 Hz m, the optimal electromechanical coupling factor (k p) of 5.1 % and a mechanical quality factor (Q mp) of 2550 are obtained simultaneously in BTF-4Yb. lists the comparison of d 33 and T C of the reported BTF-based ceramics. In this work, a high d 33 of 21.4 pC/N with a large T C of 771 \u2103 is achieved in BTF-4Yb, which is superior to that of previous works. Based on these properties, it can be shown that ytterbium-substituted BTF ceramics are excellent candidates for high-temperature applications. To investigate the macroscopic ferroelectric behaviors of BTF-100xYb ceramics, (a) and (b) present the polarization-electric field (P-E) loops and electric current density-electric field (J-E) curves, measured at 160 kV/cm, 1 Hz, and 150 \xb0C. All BTF-100xYb ceramic samples exhibit typical ferroelectric P-E loops, indicating the formation of good ferroelectric properties. Compared to unmodified BTF, the P-E loop for BTF-4Yb shows more saturated states, while the P-E loops become slimmer and spindly as ytterbium content increases to 20 mol%. Compared to the unmodified BTF, the current peaks of ytterbium-substituted ceramics shift to higher electric fields. As listed in , the remanent polarization (P r) of the BTF-100xYb ceramics increases as x rises from 0 to 0.04, before decreasing as x increases further to 0.20, reaching its maximum for BTF-4Yb. The largest remnant polarization of BTF-4Yb suggests excellent piezoelectricity. For ytterbium-substituted BTF ceramics, the improvement in piezoelectric properties compared to unmodified BTF seems to be primarily due to slight lattice distortion, increased grain size, improved insulation, and reduced oxygen vacancy concentration. Additionally, it is worth noting that the symmetry of the P-E loop is not ideal (E c+ \u2260 E c-), which can be attributed to the presence of an internal bias field induced by an increase in the number of defective dipole pairs within the material. illustrates the thermal annealing behavior of BTF-100xYb ceramics to evaluate their piezoelectric performance after annealing treatment. In the low-annealing temperature range (< 300 \xb0C), the d 33 values show a slight decrease but retain more than 90 % of their original values due to thermally activated reverse switching in the non-180 \xb0 domains. As the temperature increases from 300 to 600 \xb0C, the d 33 values decrease more rapidly with higher ytterbium doping but still maintain above 80 % of their original values. However, the introduction of ytterbium stabilizes the (Bi2O2)E^{2+} layer and reduces the oxygen vacancy content, leading to a quicker decrease in d 33 values. Notably, the ytterbium-substituted ceramics retain a high piezoelectric constant (d 33 > 75 % of the original values) even after annealing at 700 \xb0C, whereas the unmodified BTF almost completely loses its piezoelectricity. To study the thermal stability of the piezoelectric performance in ytterbium-substituted BTF, we examined the temperature-dependent electrical impedance of BTF-4Yb, as shown in , where the frequency-dependent electromechanical resonance characteristics (k p mode) at elevated temperatures are shown. At room temperature, the resonance and antiresonance frequencies appear near 252 kHz but shift steadily toward lower frequencies with decreasing impedance amplitude as the temperature increases from 30 \xb0C to 500 \xb0C. At lower temperatures (T < 300 \xb0C), the electrical impedances of the resonance peaks and valleys are Z(f a) \u223c 22.2 k\u03a9 and Z(f r) \u223c 2.4 k\u03a9 at RT, and Z(f a) \u223c 5.4 k\u03a9 and Z(f r) \u223c 3.9 k\u03a9 at 300 \xb0C, respectively, showing a considerable contrast between Z(f a) and Z(f r). However, above 300 \xb0C, the resonance amplitude decreases sharply due to increased electrical conductivity. Despite the weak resonance/antiresonance amplitude at 500 \xb0C, the resonance characteristics are still evident, indicating that BTF-4Yb retains its piezoelectric nature up to 500 \xb0C. From RT to 300 \xb0C, both f r and f a shift almost linearly to lower frequencies with increasing temperature. However, above 300 \xb0C, the resonance frequency changes dramatically due to increased conductivity. The temperature coefficients of the resonance and antiresonance frequencies are found to be approximately 90 ppm/K. Despite high temperatures, BTF-4Yb retains its resonance characteristics. Nonetheless, BTF-4Yb demonstrates good thermal stability of piezoelectric properties, indicating its potential for high-temperature piezoelectric applications.

# ABSTRACT
Aurivillius-type bismuth layer-structured ferroelectric (BLSF) bismuth titanate-ferrite (Bi5Ti3FeO15) has recently received significant attention. However, the piezoelectric properties of Bi5Ti3FeO15-based compounds have not been extensively explored due to their poor piezoelectric performance and low direct-current (dc) electrical resistivity at elevated temperatures. We conducted a detailed examination of the crystal structure, microstructural morphology, and piezoelectric properties of ytterbium-substituted Bi5Ti3FeO15. The optimal composition, 4 mol% ytterbium-substituted Bi5Ti3FeO15 (BTF-4Yb), exhibits a significantly improved piezoelectric constant (d
                     33) of 21.4 pC/N, which is three times higher than that of Bi5Ti3FeO15 (7.1 pC/N). Additionally, it shows a high dc electrical resistivity of 1.6 MΩ cm at 400 °C and a high Curie temperature (T
                     C) of 771 °C. Importantly, BTF-4Yb maintains good thermal stability of electromechanical coupling characteristics up to 300 °C. These results indicate that ytterbium-substituted Bi5Ti3FeO15 is a promising candidate for high-temperature piezoelectric ceramics, offering significant potential for applications in high-temperature piezoelectric sensors.

# INTRODUCTION
Piezoelectric materials, which convert electrical energy into mechanical energy, are highly sought after for piezoelectric applications operating at elevated temperatures (\u2265 300 \u2103) to ensure structural health monitoring and diagnostics in fields such as automotive, aerospace, and power plants. Currently, lead zirconate titanate (PZT) piezoelectric ceramics with morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) compositions are the predominant choice due to their excellent electromechanical coupling properties. However, PZT ceramics are unsuitable for high-temperature applications due to their relatively low Curie temperature (T C < 400 \u2103). Since piezoelectric materials can only be safely used up to approximately half of their T C without significant performance degradation, PZT ceramics are not viable for applications exceeding 250 \u2103. Aurivillius-type bismuth layer-structured ferroelectrics (BLSFs), such as CaBi2Nb2O9 (CBN) , Bi3TiNbO9 (BTN) , CaBi4Ti4O15 (CBT) , Bi4Ti3O12 (BIT) , Na0.5Bi2.5Nb2O9 (NBN) , have emerged as promising candidates for high-temperature applications due to their high T C exceeding 600 \u2103. The general formula for BLSF oxides is (Bi2O2)E^{2+}(A m-1 B m O3m+1)E^{2-}, where A represents monovalent, divalent, or trivalent metallic ions suitable for dodecahedral coordination, B represents tetravalent, pentavalent, or hexavalent transition metallic ions suitable for octahedral coordination, and m ranges from 1 to 5, indicating the number of octahedral layers in the perovskite slab. Despite their potential, BLSF compounds typically exhibit weak piezoelectric performance, generally piezoelectric constant (d 33) not exceeding 10 pC/N, due to high coercive fields (Ec ) and structural anisotropy. Additionally, BLSFs often suffer from low electrical resistivity, attributed to high concentrations of oxygen vacancies resulting from the volatilization of bismuth during sintering. To address these limitations, researchers have explored various methods to enhance the piezoelectric properties of BLSF compounds, such as chemical doping and grain orientation techniques. Bismuth titanate-ferrite (Bi5Ti3FeO15, BTF) with m = 4 stands out in the BLSF family as a promising high-temperature piezoelectric material, due to its high T C (\u223c761 \xb0C). While recent studies have focused on the electromagnetic and ferromagnetic coupling applications of BTF, there has been limited research on its piezoelectric properties. This is largely attributed to the material\u2019s rigid poling conditions, such as high E c and significant leakage currents. Nevertheless, chemical modification has proven to be a cost-effective strategy for simultaneously enhancing the piezoelectric properties and electrical resistivity of BTF, paving the way for large-scale manufacturing. For example, Moure et al. reported an enhanced d 33 of 18.6 pC/N in Bi5Ti3FeO15-CaBi4Ti4O15 (BTF-CBT) ; Huang et al. achieved a d 33 of 13.4 pC/N in (Na, Ce) co-modified BTF ; and Wang et al. attained a high d 33 of 23 pC/N in Mn-modified BTF. However, there is a paucity of studies on the effects of A-site rare-earth ion substitutions on the piezoelectric properties and thermal stability of BTF. In this study, we propose a strategy involving A-site substitution with ytterbium (Yb) to stabilize the (Bi2O2)E^{2+} layer and reduce the concentration of oxygen vacancies. This approach aims to enhance both the piezoelectric properties and thermal stability of BTF. We thoroughly investigate the structure, dielectric, electrical, piezoelectric, and electromechanical properties of A-site ytterbium-substituted BTF.

# CONCLUSION
Bismuth layer-structured ferroelectric Bi5Ti3FeO15 ceramics with rare-earth ytterbium ion substitutions were synthesized using the conventional solid-state reaction method. We thoroughly investigated the structural, dielectric, electrical, piezoelectric, and electromechanical properties of A-site ytterbium-substituted Bi5Ti3FeO15. The piezoelectric constant (d 33) was significantly enhanced by substituting ytterbium ions for bismuth ions, with BTF-4Yb exhibiting the optimal piezoelectric performance (d 33 = 21.4 pC/N), which is three times greater than that of BTF. The Curie temperature (T C) values slightly increased with higher ytterbium content due to the lattice distortion of the BTF caused by substituting smaller radius ytterbium ions for bismuth ions. Temperature-dependent dc electrical resistivity measurements demonstrated that proper ytterbium introduction can improve dc electrical resistivity, with BTF-4Yb showing the highest dc electrical resistivity among all the compositions. The thermal annealing behavior of BTF-100xYb ceramics indicates that ytterbium-substituted BTF ceramics have potential for high-temperature applications. Additionally, the temperature-dependent electrical impedance, resonance frequency, and anti-resonance frequency measurements show that BTF-4Yb maintains good thermal stability of electromechanical properties. These findings suggest that ytterbium-substituted BTF ceramics are promising materials for high-temperature piezoelectric applications.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of the BTF-100xYb ceramics. All diffraction peaks are well indexed by the standard diffraction data , illustrating a single orthorhombic phase with the space group A21 am. No impurity phases were detected in any of the samples, implying that the ytterbium dopant ions were successfully incorporated into the pseudo-perovskite layers, presumably occupying the BiE^{3+} at A-site. According to Shannon\u2019s law , due to the difference in effective ionic radius of YbE^{3+} (115 pm, coordination number CN = 12) and BiE^{3+} (136 pm, CN = 12), the substitution of ytterbium results in a lattice distortion, which is responsible for the intrinsic contribution to the significant enhancement in piezoelectric properties of BTF. The strongest diffraction peak (119) of BTF is consistent with the crystal surface index (112 m +1), corresponding to the strongest diffraction peak of BLSFs. Compared with X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman scattering is not only more sensitive and efficient for investigating lattice vibration modes but also provides more detailed information related to the crystallographic positions of substitutional ions and their effects on ferroelectric behavior through the occurrence of extra modes and/or shifts in peak position. presents Raman scattering spectra with Raman shifts ranging from 50 to 1000 cmE^{\u22121} at room temperature. The first type includes modes with frequencies below 200 cmE^{\u22121}, which are associated with the vibrations of Bi atoms at the A-site. The second type includes modes with frequencies above 200 cmE^{\u22121}, related to the internal vibrations of oxygen octahedra in the perovskite-like layers. In the BTF ceramic samples, prominent Raman modes appear at around 100, 116, 142, 230, 261, 333, 539, 571, and 860 cmE^{\u22121}, indicating the formation of a well-defined four-layer perovskite structure. The low-frequency Raman modes near 100, 116, and 142 cmE^{\u22121} are closely related to the vibrations of BiE^{3+} ions at the A-site of the perovskite-like slabs. The high-frequency Raman modes around 230 and 261 cmE^{\u22121} correspond to the bending vibrations of the O-Ti/Fe-O bonds in the oxygen octahedron. Raman modes near 333 cmE^{\u22121} are associated with the combined twisting and stretching vibrations of the oxygen octahedron , while the modes around 539 and 571 cmE^{\u22121} are related to the relative vibrations of the oxygen atom at the top outer end of the (Ti/Fe)O6 octahedron. The high-frequency mode appearing around 860 cmE^{\u22121} corresponds to the tensile vibrations of the TiO6 octahedron along the c-axis. After the introduction of ytterbium ions, the characteristic peaks mentioned above remain evident, suggesting that the ytterbium substitution does not significantly alter the basic structure of BTF. Notably, the high-frequency Raman modes located near 230 and 333 cmE^{\u22121} are intensified compared to the BTF, indicating the effect of ytterbium substitution on the distortion of the (Ti/Fe)O6 octahedron. This also suggests that ytterbium ions tend to replace bismuth ions, affecting the local structural environment around the BO6 octahedron, including changes in the phonon vibration frequency of the outer oxygen atom at the top of the (Ti/Fe)O6 octahedron and a reduction in local structural symmetry. Additionally, the positions and intensities of other Raman peaks show little change, indicating they are not significantly affected by the ytterbium ion replacement of bismuth ions. shows scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of natural surfaces for BTF-100xYb ceramics. All ceramic samples exhibit a compact, pore-free microstructure, indicating optimal sintering conditions for BTF-100xYb ceramics. The grains in all samples are well-developed, laminar, and randomly oriented, characteristic of BLSF ceramics. Due to the high grain growth rate perpendicular to the c-axis of BLSF crystals, the grain growth is structurally anisotropic, with the length of the plate-like grains significantly exceeding their thickness. Compared to BTF, the ytterbium-substituted BTF ceramics exhibit larger grain sizes, which are advantageous for enhancing piezoelectric properties. The average grain size of BTF increases significantly with increasing ytterbium content, demonstrating that the substitution of ytterbium improves mass diffusion and accelerates the migration of ions during the sintering process , thus facilitating the grain growth. This observation is consistent with recent reports on other BLSF compounds. Ceramics with low electrical resistivity can generate high leakage currents, leading to charge drift and interference with the detection of charges induced by the piezoelectric effect. (a) shows the temperature dependence of the dc electrical resistivity of BTF-100xYb ceramics. As shown in , the maximum resistivity values are observed for BTF-4Yb, measuring 2.4\xd710E^{7} \u03a9 cm at 300 \xb0C, 1.6\xd710E^{6} \u03a9 cm at 400 \xb0C, and 1.8\xd710E^{5} \u03a9 cm at 500 \xb0C. These values are higher than those of BTF, which are 8.8\xd710E^{6} \u03a9 cm at 300 \u2103, 5.6\xd710E^{5} \u03a9 cm at 400 \u2103, and 6.7\xd710E^{4} \u03a9 cm at 500 \u2103. The high dc electrical resistivity allows ytterbium-substituted BTF ceramics to withstand higher electric fields, enhancing their piezoelectric properties through sufficient polarization. The (Bi2O2)E^{2+} layers play a crucial role in space-charge compensation in Aurivillius-type compounds, improving electrical properties by suppressing leakage currents. Bismuth ions tend to volatilize during high-temperature sintering due to its relatively low melting point (\u223c820 \xb0C), leading to the formation of oxygen vacancies that act as charge carriers. The substitution of the highly volatile bismuth ions with ytterbium ions, which have a higher melting point (\u223c2346 \xb0C), can effectively suppress bismuth loss during sintering. This stabilization of the (Bi2O2)E^{2+} layers reduced the formation of point defects such as oxygen vacancies. In Aurivillius-type materials, grain growth is structurally anisotropic, occurring primarily in the a-b plane, while the (Bi2O2)E^{2+} layers along the c-axis act as natural insulating media. Larger grain sizes in ytterbium-substituted ceramics facilitate long-range charge transport due to reduced grain boundary effects and weaker insulation by the (Bi2O2)E^{2+} layers. This explains why the resistivity decreases with increasing ytterbium substitution, particularly in BTF-20Yb. The temperature-dependent resistivity behavior follows the Arrhenius relationship : \u03c1 = \u03c1 0 exp (E a/k B T), where \u03c1 0 is a pre-exponential factor, E a is the activation energy, k B is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute temperature. An activation energy of \u223c0.90 eV, typical for the migration enthalpy of oxygen, suggests that the electrical conduction process in BTF-100xYb ceramics is dominated by the oxygen vacancies. shows the dielectric constant (\u03b5 r) and dielectric loss (tan\u03b4) of BTF-100xYb measured at 1 MHz. The \u03b5 r of all samples increases gradually as the temperature rises from room temperature (RT) to 500 \xb0C. However, it increases sharply above 500 \xb0C due to high electrical conductivity. All samples exhibit a distinct peak in \u03b5 r, corresponding to the ferroelectric-to-paraelectric phase transition, i.e., the T C of the material. Although only one phase transition is observed in BTF-100xYb, BTF-20Yb shows a small bump around 600 \xb0C, attributed to space charge effects, which is consistent with observations in Co-doped BTF. As indicated in the inset of (a) and , T C values significantly increase with ytterbium substitution, due to the distortion of the BTF lattice caused by the introduction of ytterbium ions. The optimal composition, BTF-4Yb, has a T C of 771 \xb0C, and the maximum T C of 805 \xb0C is achieved for BTF-20Yb, which is 42 \xb0C higher than that of unmodified BTF (763 \xb0C). Previous studies have shown that T C values in BLSFs are strongly related to the degree of structural distortion , described by the tolerance factor (t), defined as t= R A+ R O 2( R B+ R O), where R A , R B , and R O are the ionic radii of A-site cations, B-site cations, and oxygen ions, respectively. According to Shannon\u2019s law , compared with BiE^{3+} (136 pm, CN = 12) at the A-site, the substitution of YbE^{3+} (115 pm, CN = 12) with a smaller ionic radius at the A-site leads to a decrease in t and an increase in T C. Similarly, as shown in (b), the tan\u03b4 increases gradually up to 500 \xb0C but rises sharply above 500 \xb0C due to high conductivity and thermally activated domain wall movements. Research suggests that oxygen vacancies (Vo..) resulting from bismuth volatilization during the calcination process act as space charges, leading to the domain pinning effect and increased tan\u03b4. However, the dielectric loss of BTF-4Yb ceramics is lower than 0.03 below 300 \xb0C, which is conducive to its application in high temperature scenarios. Benefitting from the slight lattice distortion, increased grain size, and reduced oxygen vacancy concentration induced by the introduction of ytterbium, the piezoelectric and electromechanical properties of BTF-100xYb ceramics are significantly improved. As listed in , the piezoelectric constant d 33 is prominently improved and shows a trend of first increasing and then decreasing with the increasing ytterbium substitution. The optimal piezoelectric performance with a maximum d 33 value of 21.4 pC/N is achieved by BTF-4Yb, which is more than three times that of the unmodified BTF of 7.1 pC/N. In addition, an enhanced planar frequency constant (N p) of 2096 Hz m, the optimal electromechanical coupling factor (k p) of 5.1 % and a mechanical quality factor (Q mp) of 2550 are obtained simultaneously in BTF-4Yb. lists the comparison of d 33 and T C of the reported BTF-based ceramics. In this work, a high d 33 of 21.4 pC/N with a large T C of 771 \u2103 is achieved in BTF-4Yb, which is superior to that of previous works. Based on these properties, it can be shown that ytterbium-substituted BTF ceramics are excellent candidates for high-temperature applications. To investigate the macroscopic ferroelectric behaviors of BTF-100xYb ceramics, (a) and (b) present the polarization-electric field (P-E) loops and electric current density-electric field (J-E) curves, measured at 160 kV/cm, 1 Hz, and 150 \xb0C. All BTF-100xYb ceramic samples exhibit typical ferroelectric P-E loops, indicating the formation of good ferroelectric properties. Compared to unmodified BTF, the P-E loop for BTF-4Yb shows more saturated states, while the P-E loops become slimmer and spindly as ytterbium content increases to 20 mol%. Compared to the unmodified BTF, the current peaks of ytterbium-substituted ceramics shift to higher electric fields. As listed in , the remanent polarization (P r) of the BTF-100xYb ceramics increases as x rises from 0 to 0.04, before decreasing as x increases further to 0.20, reaching its maximum for BTF-4Yb. The largest remnant polarization of BTF-4Yb suggests excellent piezoelectricity. For ytterbium-substituted BTF ceramics, the improvement in piezoelectric properties compared to unmodified BTF seems to be primarily due to slight lattice distortion, increased grain size, improved insulation, and reduced oxygen vacancy concentration. Additionally, it is worth noting that the symmetry of the P-E loop is not ideal (E c+ \u2260 E c-), which can be attributed to the presence of an internal bias field induced by an increase in the number of defective dipole pairs within the material. illustrates the thermal annealing behavior of BTF-100xYb ceramics to evaluate their piezoelectric performance after annealing treatment. In the low-annealing temperature range (< 300 \xb0C), the d 33 values show a slight decrease but retain more than 90 % of their original values due to thermally activated reverse switching in the non-180 \xb0 domains. As the temperature increases from 300 to 600 \xb0C, the d 33 values decrease more rapidly with higher ytterbium doping but still maintain above 80 % of their original values. However, the introduction of ytterbium stabilizes the (Bi2O2)E^{2+} layer and reduces the oxygen vacancy content, leading to a quicker decrease in d 33 values. Notably, the ytterbium-substituted ceramics retain a high piezoelectric constant (d 33 > 75 % of the original values) even after annealing at 700 \xb0C, whereas the unmodified BTF almost completely loses its piezoelectricity. To study the thermal stability of the piezoelectric performance in ytterbium-substituted BTF, we examined the temperature-dependent electrical impedance of BTF-4Yb, as shown in , where the frequency-dependent electromechanical resonance characteristics (k p mode) at elevated temperatures are shown. At room temperature, the resonance and antiresonance frequencies appear near 252 kHz but shift steadily toward lower frequencies with decreasing impedance amplitude as the temperature increases from 30 \xb0C to 500 \xb0C. At lower temperatures (T < 300 \xb0C), the electrical impedances of the resonance peaks and valleys are Z(f a) \u223c 22.2 k\u03a9 and Z(f r) \u223c 2.4 k\u03a9 at RT, and Z(f a) \u223c 5.4 k\u03a9 and Z(f r) \u223c 3.9 k\u03a9 at 300 \xb0C, respectively, showing a considerable contrast between Z(f a) and Z(f r). However, above 300 \xb0C, the resonance amplitude decreases sharply due to increased electrical conductivity. Despite the weak resonance/antiresonance amplitude at 500 \xb0C, the resonance characteristics are still evident, indicating that BTF-4Yb retains its piezoelectric nature up to 500 \xb0C. From RT to 300 \xb0C, both f r and f a shift almost linearly to lower frequencies with increasing temperature. However, above 300 \xb0C, the resonance frequency changes dramatically due to increased conductivity. The temperature coefficients of the resonance and antiresonance frequencies are found to be approximately 90 ppm/K. Despite high temperatures, BTF-4Yb retains its resonance characteristics. Nonetheless, BTF-4Yb demonstrates good thermal stability of piezoelectric properties, indicating its potential for high-temperature piezoelectric applications.

# ABSTRACT
Aurivillius-type bismuth layer-structured ferroelectric (BLSF) bismuth titanate-ferrite (Bi5Ti3FeO15) has recently received significant attention. However, the piezoelectric properties of Bi5Ti3FeO15-based compounds have not been extensively explored due to their poor piezoelectric performance and low direct-current (dc) electrical resistivity at elevated temperatures. We conducted a detailed examination of the crystal structure, microstructural morphology, and piezoelectric properties of ytterbium-substituted Bi5Ti3FeO15. The optimal composition, 4 mol% ytterbium-substituted Bi5Ti3FeO15 (BTF-4Yb), exhibits a significantly improved piezoelectric constant (d
                     33) of 21.4 pC/N, which is three times higher than that of Bi5Ti3FeO15 (7.1 pC/N). Additionally, it shows a high dc electrical resistivity of 1.6 MΩ cm at 400 °C and a high Curie temperature (T
                     C) of 771 °C. Importantly, BTF-4Yb maintains good thermal stability of electromechanical coupling characteristics up to 300 °C. These results indicate that ytterbium-substituted Bi5Ti3FeO15 is a promising candidate for high-temperature piezoelectric ceramics, offering significant potential for applications in high-temperature piezoelectric sensors.

# INTRODUCTION
Piezoelectric materials, which convert electrical energy into mechanical energy, are highly sought after for piezoelectric applications operating at elevated temperatures (\u2265 300 \u2103) to ensure structural health monitoring and diagnostics in fields such as automotive, aerospace, and power plants. Currently, lead zirconate titanate (PZT) piezoelectric ceramics with morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) compositions are the predominant choice due to their excellent electromechanical coupling properties. However, PZT ceramics are unsuitable for high-temperature applications due to their relatively low Curie temperature (T C < 400 \u2103). Since piezoelectric materials can only be safely used up to approximately half of their T C without significant performance degradation, PZT ceramics are not viable for applications exceeding 250 \u2103. Aurivillius-type bismuth layer-structured ferroelectrics (BLSFs), such as CaBi2Nb2O9 (CBN) , Bi3TiNbO9 (BTN) , CaBi4Ti4O15 (CBT) , Bi4Ti3O12 (BIT) , Na0.5Bi2.5Nb2O9 (NBN) , have emerged as promising candidates for high-temperature applications due to their high T C exceeding 600 \u2103. The general formula for BLSF oxides is (Bi2O2)E^{2+}(A m-1 B m O3m+1)E^{2-}, where A represents monovalent, divalent, or trivalent metallic ions suitable for dodecahedral coordination, B represents tetravalent, pentavalent, or hexavalent transition metallic ions suitable for octahedral coordination, and m ranges from 1 to 5, indicating the number of octahedral layers in the perovskite slab. Despite their potential, BLSF compounds typically exhibit weak piezoelectric performance, generally piezoelectric constant (d 33) not exceeding 10 pC/N, due to high coercive fields (Ec ) and structural anisotropy. Additionally, BLSFs often suffer from low electrical resistivity, attributed to high concentrations of oxygen vacancies resulting from the volatilization of bismuth during sintering. To address these limitations, researchers have explored various methods to enhance the piezoelectric properties of BLSF compounds, such as chemical doping and grain orientation techniques. Bismuth titanate-ferrite (Bi5Ti3FeO15, BTF) with m = 4 stands out in the BLSF family as a promising high-temperature piezoelectric material, due to its high T C (\u223c761 \xb0C). While recent studies have focused on the electromagnetic and ferromagnetic coupling applications of BTF, there has been limited research on its piezoelectric properties. This is largely attributed to the material\u2019s rigid poling conditions, such as high E c and significant leakage currents. Nevertheless, chemical modification has proven to be a cost-effective strategy for simultaneously enhancing the piezoelectric properties and electrical resistivity of BTF, paving the way for large-scale manufacturing. For example, Moure et al. reported an enhanced d 33 of 18.6 pC/N in Bi5Ti3FeO15-CaBi4Ti4O15 (BTF-CBT) ; Huang et al. achieved a d 33 of 13.4 pC/N in (Na, Ce) co-modified BTF ; and Wang et al. attained a high d 33 of 23 pC/N in Mn-modified BTF. However, there is a paucity of studies on the effects of A-site rare-earth ion substitutions on the piezoelectric properties and thermal stability of BTF. In this study, we propose a strategy involving A-site substitution with ytterbium (Yb) to stabilize the (Bi2O2)E^{2+} layer and reduce the concentration of oxygen vacancies. This approach aims to enhance both the piezoelectric properties and thermal stability of BTF. We thoroughly investigate the structure, dielectric, electrical, piezoelectric, and electromechanical properties of A-site ytterbium-substituted BTF.

# CONCLUSION
Bismuth layer-structured ferroelectric Bi5Ti3FeO15 ceramics with rare-earth ytterbium ion substitutions were synthesized using the conventional solid-state reaction method. We thoroughly investigated the structural, dielectric, electrical, piezoelectric, and electromechanical properties of A-site ytterbium-substituted Bi5Ti3FeO15. The piezoelectric constant (d 33) was significantly enhanced by substituting ytterbium ions for bismuth ions, with BTF-4Yb exhibiting the optimal piezoelectric performance (d 33 = 21.4 pC/N), which is three times greater than that of BTF. The Curie temperature (T C) values slightly increased with higher ytterbium content due to the lattice distortion of the BTF caused by substituting smaller radius ytterbium ions for bismuth ions. Temperature-dependent dc electrical resistivity measurements demonstrated that proper ytterbium introduction can improve dc electrical resistivity, with BTF-4Yb showing the highest dc electrical resistivity among all the compositions. The thermal annealing behavior of BTF-100xYb ceramics indicates that ytterbium-substituted BTF ceramics have potential for high-temperature applications. Additionally, the temperature-dependent electrical impedance, resonance frequency, and anti-resonance frequency measurements show that BTF-4Yb maintains good thermal stability of electromechanical properties. These findings suggest that ytterbium-substituted BTF ceramics are promising materials for high-temperature piezoelectric applications.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of the BTF-100xYb ceramics. All diffraction peaks are well indexed by the standard diffraction data , illustrating a single orthorhombic phase with the space group A21 am. No impurity phases were detected in any of the samples, implying that the ytterbium dopant ions were successfully incorporated into the pseudo-perovskite layers, presumably occupying the BiE^{3+} at A-site. According to Shannon\u2019s law , due to the difference in effective ionic radius of YbE^{3+} (115 pm, coordination number CN = 12) and BiE^{3+} (136 pm, CN = 12), the substitution of ytterbium results in a lattice distortion, which is responsible for the intrinsic contribution to the significant enhancement in piezoelectric properties of BTF. The strongest diffraction peak (119) of BTF is consistent with the crystal surface index (112 m +1), corresponding to the strongest diffraction peak of BLSFs. Compared with X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman scattering is not only more sensitive and efficient for investigating lattice vibration modes but also provides more detailed information related to the crystallographic positions of substitutional ions and their effects on ferroelectric behavior through the occurrence of extra modes and/or shifts in peak position. presents Raman scattering spectra with Raman shifts ranging from 50 to 1000 cmE^{\u22121} at room temperature. The first type includes modes with frequencies below 200 cmE^{\u22121}, which are associated with the vibrations of Bi atoms at the A-site. The second type includes modes with frequencies above 200 cmE^{\u22121}, related to the internal vibrations of oxygen octahedra in the perovskite-like layers. In the BTF ceramic samples, prominent Raman modes appear at around 100, 116, 142, 230, 261, 333, 539, 571, and 860 cmE^{\u22121}, indicating the formation of a well-defined four-layer perovskite structure. The low-frequency Raman modes near 100, 116, and 142 cmE^{\u22121} are closely related to the vibrations of BiE^{3+} ions at the A-site of the perovskite-like slabs. The high-frequency Raman modes around 230 and 261 cmE^{\u22121} correspond to the bending vibrations of the O-Ti/Fe-O bonds in the oxygen octahedron. Raman modes near 333 cmE^{\u22121} are associated with the combined twisting and stretching vibrations of the oxygen octahedron , while the modes around 539 and 571 cmE^{\u22121} are related to the relative vibrations of the oxygen atom at the top outer end of the (Ti/Fe)O6 octahedron. The high-frequency mode appearing around 860 cmE^{\u22121} corresponds to the tensile vibrations of the TiO6 octahedron along the c-axis. After the introduction of ytterbium ions, the characteristic peaks mentioned above remain evident, suggesting that the ytterbium substitution does not significantly alter the basic structure of BTF. Notably, the high-frequency Raman modes located near 230 and 333 cmE^{\u22121} are intensified compared to the BTF, indicating the effect of ytterbium substitution on the distortion of the (Ti/Fe)O6 octahedron. This also suggests that ytterbium ions tend to replace bismuth ions, affecting the local structural environment around the BO6 octahedron, including changes in the phonon vibration frequency of the outer oxygen atom at the top of the (Ti/Fe)O6 octahedron and a reduction in local structural symmetry. Additionally, the positions and intensities of other Raman peaks show little change, indicating they are not significantly affected by the ytterbium ion replacement of bismuth ions. shows scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of natural surfaces for BTF-100xYb ceramics. All ceramic samples exhibit a compact, pore-free microstructure, indicating optimal sintering conditions for BTF-100xYb ceramics. The grains in all samples are well-developed, laminar, and randomly oriented, characteristic of BLSF ceramics. Due to the high grain growth rate perpendicular to the c-axis of BLSF crystals, the grain growth is structurally anisotropic, with the length of the plate-like grains significantly exceeding their thickness. Compared to BTF, the ytterbium-substituted BTF ceramics exhibit larger grain sizes, which are advantageous for enhancing piezoelectric properties. The average grain size of BTF increases significantly with increasing ytterbium content, demonstrating that the substitution of ytterbium improves mass diffusion and accelerates the migration of ions during the sintering process , thus facilitating the grain growth. This observation is consistent with recent reports on other BLSF compounds. Ceramics with low electrical resistivity can generate high leakage currents, leading to charge drift and interference with the detection of charges induced by the piezoelectric effect. (a) shows the temperature dependence of the dc electrical resistivity of BTF-100xYb ceramics. As shown in , the maximum resistivity values are observed for BTF-4Yb, measuring 2.4\xd710E^{7} \u03a9 cm at 300 \xb0C, 1.6\xd710E^{6} \u03a9 cm at 400 \xb0C, and 1.8\xd710E^{5} \u03a9 cm at 500 \xb0C. These values are higher than those of BTF, which are 8.8\xd710E^{6} \u03a9 cm at 300 \u2103, 5.6\xd710E^{5} \u03a9 cm at 400 \u2103, and 6.7\xd710E^{4} \u03a9 cm at 500 \u2103. The high dc electrical resistivity allows ytterbium-substituted BTF ceramics to withstand higher electric fields, enhancing their piezoelectric properties through sufficient polarization. The (Bi2O2)E^{2+} layers play a crucial role in space-charge compensation in Aurivillius-type compounds, improving electrical properties by suppressing leakage currents. Bismuth ions tend to volatilize during high-temperature sintering due to its relatively low melting point (\u223c820 \xb0C), leading to the formation of oxygen vacancies that act as charge carriers. The substitution of the highly volatile bismuth ions with ytterbium ions, which have a higher melting point (\u223c2346 \xb0C), can effectively suppress bismuth loss during sintering. This stabilization of the (Bi2O2)E^{2+} layers reduced the formation of point defects such as oxygen vacancies. In Aurivillius-type materials, grain growth is structurally anisotropic, occurring primarily in the a-b plane, while the (Bi2O2)E^{2+} layers along the c-axis act as natural insulating media. Larger grain sizes in ytterbium-substituted ceramics facilitate long-range charge transport due to reduced grain boundary effects and weaker insulation by the (Bi2O2)E^{2+} layers. This explains why the resistivity decreases with increasing ytterbium substitution, particularly in BTF-20Yb. The temperature-dependent resistivity behavior follows the Arrhenius relationship : \u03c1 = \u03c1 0 exp (E a/k B T), where \u03c1 0 is a pre-exponential factor, E a is the activation energy, k B is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute temperature. An activation energy of \u223c0.90 eV, typical for the migration enthalpy of oxygen, suggests that the electrical conduction process in BTF-100xYb ceramics is dominated by the oxygen vacancies. shows the dielectric constant (\u03b5 r) and dielectric loss (tan\u03b4) of BTF-100xYb measured at 1 MHz. The \u03b5 r of all samples increases gradually as the temperature rises from room temperature (RT) to 500 \xb0C. However, it increases sharply above 500 \xb0C due to high electrical conductivity. All samples exhibit a distinct peak in \u03b5 r, corresponding to the ferroelectric-to-paraelectric phase transition, i.e., the T C of the material. Although only one phase transition is observed in BTF-100xYb, BTF-20Yb shows a small bump around 600 \xb0C, attributed to space charge effects, which is consistent with observations in Co-doped BTF. As indicated in the inset of (a) and , T C values significantly increase with ytterbium substitution, due to the distortion of the BTF lattice caused by the introduction of ytterbium ions. The optimal composition, BTF-4Yb, has a T C of 771 \xb0C, and the maximum T C of 805 \xb0C is achieved for BTF-20Yb, which is 42 \xb0C higher than that of unmodified BTF (763 \xb0C). Previous studies have shown that T C values in BLSFs are strongly related to the degree of structural distortion , described by the tolerance factor (t), defined as t= R A+ R O 2( R B+ R O), where R A , R B , and R O are the ionic radii of A-site cations, B-site cations, and oxygen ions, respectively. According to Shannon\u2019s law , compared with BiE^{3+} (136 pm, CN = 12) at the A-site, the substitution of YbE^{3+} (115 pm, CN = 12) with a smaller ionic radius at the A-site leads to a decrease in t and an increase in T C. Similarly, as shown in (b), the tan\u03b4 increases gradually up to 500 \xb0C but rises sharply above 500 \xb0C due to high conductivity and thermally activated domain wall movements. Research suggests that oxygen vacancies (Vo..) resulting from bismuth volatilization during the calcination process act as space charges, leading to the domain pinning effect and increased tan\u03b4. However, the dielectric loss of BTF-4Yb ceramics is lower than 0.03 below 300 \xb0C, which is conducive to its application in high temperature scenarios. Benefitting from the slight lattice distortion, increased grain size, and reduced oxygen vacancy concentration induced by the introduction of ytterbium, the piezoelectric and electromechanical properties of BTF-100xYb ceramics are significantly improved. As listed in , the piezoelectric constant d 33 is prominently improved and shows a trend of first increasing and then decreasing with the increasing ytterbium substitution. The optimal piezoelectric performance with a maximum d 33 value of 21.4 pC/N is achieved by BTF-4Yb, which is more than three times that of the unmodified BTF of 7.1 pC/N. In addition, an enhanced planar frequency constant (N p) of 2096 Hz m, the optimal electromechanical coupling factor (k p) of 5.1 % and a mechanical quality factor (Q mp) of 2550 are obtained simultaneously in BTF-4Yb. lists the comparison of d 33 and T C of the reported BTF-based ceramics. In this work, a high d 33 of 21.4 pC/N with a large T C of 771 \u2103 is achieved in BTF-4Yb, which is superior to that of previous works. Based on these properties, it can be shown that ytterbium-substituted BTF ceramics are excellent candidates for high-temperature applications. To investigate the macroscopic ferroelectric behaviors of BTF-100xYb ceramics, (a) and (b) present the polarization-electric field (P-E) loops and electric current density-electric field (J-E) curves, measured at 160 kV/cm, 1 Hz, and 150 \xb0C. All BTF-100xYb ceramic samples exhibit typical ferroelectric P-E loops, indicating the formation of good ferroelectric properties. Compared to unmodified BTF, the P-E loop for BTF-4Yb shows more saturated states, while the P-E loops become slimmer and spindly as ytterbium content increases to 20 mol%. Compared to the unmodified BTF, the current peaks of ytterbium-substituted ceramics shift to higher electric fields. As listed in , the remanent polarization (P r) of the BTF-100xYb ceramics increases as x rises from 0 to 0.04, before decreasing as x increases further to 0.20, reaching its maximum for BTF-4Yb. The largest remnant polarization of BTF-4Yb suggests excellent piezoelectricity. For ytterbium-substituted BTF ceramics, the improvement in piezoelectric properties compared to unmodified BTF seems to be primarily due to slight lattice distortion, increased grain size, improved insulation, and reduced oxygen vacancy concentration. Additionally, it is worth noting that the symmetry of the P-E loop is not ideal (E c+ \u2260 E c-), which can be attributed to the presence of an internal bias field induced by an increase in the number of defective dipole pairs within the material. illustrates the thermal annealing behavior of BTF-100xYb ceramics to evaluate their piezoelectric performance after annealing treatment. In the low-annealing temperature range (< 300 \xb0C), the d 33 values show a slight decrease but retain more than 90 % of their original values due to thermally activated reverse switching in the non-180 \xb0 domains. As the temperature increases from 300 to 600 \xb0C, the d 33 values decrease more rapidly with higher ytterbium doping but still maintain above 80 % of their original values. However, the introduction of ytterbium stabilizes the (Bi2O2)E^{2+} layer and reduces the oxygen vacancy content, leading to a quicker decrease in d 33 values. Notably, the ytterbium-substituted ceramics retain a high piezoelectric constant (d 33 > 75 % of the original values) even after annealing at 700 \xb0C, whereas the unmodified BTF almost completely loses its piezoelectricity. To study the thermal stability of the piezoelectric performance in ytterbium-substituted BTF, we examined the temperature-dependent electrical impedance of BTF-4Yb, as shown in , where the frequency-dependent electromechanical resonance characteristics (k p mode) at elevated temperatures are shown. At room temperature, the resonance and antiresonance frequencies appear near 252 kHz but shift steadily toward lower frequencies with decreasing impedance amplitude as the temperature increases from 30 \xb0C to 500 \xb0C. At lower temperatures (T < 300 \xb0C), the electrical impedances of the resonance peaks and valleys are Z(f a) \u223c 22.2 k\u03a9 and Z(f r) \u223c 2.4 k\u03a9 at RT, and Z(f a) \u223c 5.4 k\u03a9 and Z(f r) \u223c 3.9 k\u03a9 at 300 \xb0C, respectively, showing a considerable contrast between Z(f a) and Z(f r). However, above 300 \xb0C, the resonance amplitude decreases sharply due to increased electrical conductivity. Despite the weak resonance/antiresonance amplitude at 500 \xb0C, the resonance characteristics are still evident, indicating that BTF-4Yb retains its piezoelectric nature up to 500 \xb0C. From RT to 300 \xb0C, both f r and f a shift almost linearly to lower frequencies with increasing temperature. However, above 300 \xb0C, the resonance frequency changes dramatically due to increased conductivity. The temperature coefficients of the resonance and antiresonance frequencies are found to be approximately 90 ppm/K. Despite high temperatures, BTF-4Yb retains its resonance characteristics. Nonetheless, BTF-4Yb demonstrates good thermal stability of piezoelectric properties, indicating its potential for high-temperature piezoelectric applications.

# ABSTRACT
Aurivillius-type bismuth layer-structured ferroelectric (BLSF) bismuth titanate-ferrite (Bi5Ti3FeO15) has recently received significant attention. However, the piezoelectric properties of Bi5Ti3FeO15-based compounds have not been extensively explored due to their poor piezoelectric performance and low direct-current (dc) electrical resistivity at elevated temperatures. We conducted a detailed examination of the crystal structure, microstructural morphology, and piezoelectric properties of ytterbium-substituted Bi5Ti3FeO15. The optimal composition, 4 mol% ytterbium-substituted Bi5Ti3FeO15 (BTF-4Yb), exhibits a significantly improved piezoelectric constant (d
                     33) of 21.4 pC/N, which is three times higher than that of Bi5Ti3FeO15 (7.1 pC/N). Additionally, it shows a high dc electrical resistivity of 1.6 MΩ cm at 400 °C and a high Curie temperature (T
                     C) of 771 °C. Importantly, BTF-4Yb maintains good thermal stability of electromechanical coupling characteristics up to 300 °C. These results indicate that ytterbium-substituted Bi5Ti3FeO15 is a promising candidate for high-temperature piezoelectric ceramics, offering significant potential for applications in high-temperature piezoelectric sensors.

# INTRODUCTION
Piezoelectric materials, which convert electrical energy into mechanical energy, are highly sought after for piezoelectric applications operating at elevated temperatures (\u2265 300 \u2103) to ensure structural health monitoring and diagnostics in fields such as automotive, aerospace, and power plants. Currently, lead zirconate titanate (PZT) piezoelectric ceramics with morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) compositions are the predominant choice due to their excellent electromechanical coupling properties. However, PZT ceramics are unsuitable for high-temperature applications due to their relatively low Curie temperature (T C < 400 \u2103). Since piezoelectric materials can only be safely used up to approximately half of their T C without significant performance degradation, PZT ceramics are not viable for applications exceeding 250 \u2103. Aurivillius-type bismuth layer-structured ferroelectrics (BLSFs), such as CaBi2Nb2O9 (CBN) , Bi3TiNbO9 (BTN) , CaBi4Ti4O15 (CBT) , Bi4Ti3O12 (BIT) , Na0.5Bi2.5Nb2O9 (NBN) , have emerged as promising candidates for high-temperature applications due to their high T C exceeding 600 \u2103. The general formula for BLSF oxides is (Bi2O2)E^{2+}(A m-1 B m O3m+1)E^{2-}, where A represents monovalent, divalent, or trivalent metallic ions suitable for dodecahedral coordination, B represents tetravalent, pentavalent, or hexavalent transition metallic ions suitable for octahedral coordination, and m ranges from 1 to 5, indicating the number of octahedral layers in the perovskite slab. Despite their potential, BLSF compounds typically exhibit weak piezoelectric performance, generally piezoelectric constant (d 33) not exceeding 10 pC/N, due to high coercive fields (Ec ) and structural anisotropy. Additionally, BLSFs often suffer from low electrical resistivity, attributed to high concentrations of oxygen vacancies resulting from the volatilization of bismuth during sintering. To address these limitations, researchers have explored various methods to enhance the piezoelectric properties of BLSF compounds, such as chemical doping and grain orientation techniques. Bismuth titanate-ferrite (Bi5Ti3FeO15, BTF) with m = 4 stands out in the BLSF family as a promising high-temperature piezoelectric material, due to its high T C (\u223c761 \xb0C). While recent studies have focused on the electromagnetic and ferromagnetic coupling applications of BTF, there has been limited research on its piezoelectric properties. This is largely attributed to the material\u2019s rigid poling conditions, such as high E c and significant leakage currents. Nevertheless, chemical modification has proven to be a cost-effective strategy for simultaneously enhancing the piezoelectric properties and electrical resistivity of BTF, paving the way for large-scale manufacturing. For example, Moure et al. reported an enhanced d 33 of 18.6 pC/N in Bi5Ti3FeO15-CaBi4Ti4O15 (BTF-CBT) ; Huang et al. achieved a d 33 of 13.4 pC/N in (Na, Ce) co-modified BTF ; and Wang et al. attained a high d 33 of 23 pC/N in Mn-modified BTF. However, there is a paucity of studies on the effects of A-site rare-earth ion substitutions on the piezoelectric properties and thermal stability of BTF. In this study, we propose a strategy involving A-site substitution with ytterbium (Yb) to stabilize the (Bi2O2)E^{2+} layer and reduce the concentration of oxygen vacancies. This approach aims to enhance both the piezoelectric properties and thermal stability of BTF. We thoroughly investigate the structure, dielectric, electrical, piezoelectric, and electromechanical properties of A-site ytterbium-substituted BTF.

# CONCLUSION
Bismuth layer-structured ferroelectric Bi5Ti3FeO15 ceramics with rare-earth ytterbium ion substitutions were synthesized using the conventional solid-state reaction method. We thoroughly investigated the structural, dielectric, electrical, piezoelectric, and electromechanical properties of A-site ytterbium-substituted Bi5Ti3FeO15. The piezoelectric constant (d 33) was significantly enhanced by substituting ytterbium ions for bismuth ions, with BTF-4Yb exhibiting the optimal piezoelectric performance (d 33 = 21.4 pC/N), which is three times greater than that of BTF. The Curie temperature (T C) values slightly increased with higher ytterbium content due to the lattice distortion of the BTF caused by substituting smaller radius ytterbium ions for bismuth ions. Temperature-dependent dc electrical resistivity measurements demonstrated that proper ytterbium introduction can improve dc electrical resistivity, with BTF-4Yb showing the highest dc electrical resistivity among all the compositions. The thermal annealing behavior of BTF-100xYb ceramics indicates that ytterbium-substituted BTF ceramics have potential for high-temperature applications. Additionally, the temperature-dependent electrical impedance, resonance frequency, and anti-resonance frequency measurements show that BTF-4Yb maintains good thermal stability of electromechanical properties. These findings suggest that ytterbium-substituted BTF ceramics are promising materials for high-temperature piezoelectric applications.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of the BTF-100xYb ceramics. All diffraction peaks are well indexed by the standard diffraction data , illustrating a single orthorhombic phase with the space group A21 am. No impurity phases were detected in any of the samples, implying that the ytterbium dopant ions were successfully incorporated into the pseudo-perovskite layers, presumably occupying the BiE^{3+} at A-site. According to Shannon\u2019s law , due to the difference in effective ionic radius of YbE^{3+} (115 pm, coordination number CN = 12) and BiE^{3+} (136 pm, CN = 12), the substitution of ytterbium results in a lattice distortion, which is responsible for the intrinsic contribution to the significant enhancement in piezoelectric properties of BTF. The strongest diffraction peak (119) of BTF is consistent with the crystal surface index (112 m +1), corresponding to the strongest diffraction peak of BLSFs. Compared with X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman scattering is not only more sensitive and efficient for investigating lattice vibration modes but also provides more detailed information related to the crystallographic positions of substitutional ions and their effects on ferroelectric behavior through the occurrence of extra modes and/or shifts in peak position. presents Raman scattering spectra with Raman shifts ranging from 50 to 1000 cmE^{\u22121} at room temperature. The first type includes modes with frequencies below 200 cmE^{\u22121}, which are associated with the vibrations of Bi atoms at the A-site. The second type includes modes with frequencies above 200 cmE^{\u22121}, related to the internal vibrations of oxygen octahedra in the perovskite-like layers. In the BTF ceramic samples, prominent Raman modes appear at around 100, 116, 142, 230, 261, 333, 539, 571, and 860 cmE^{\u22121}, indicating the formation of a well-defined four-layer perovskite structure. The low-frequency Raman modes near 100, 116, and 142 cmE^{\u22121} are closely related to the vibrations of BiE^{3+} ions at the A-site of the perovskite-like slabs. The high-frequency Raman modes around 230 and 261 cmE^{\u22121} correspond to the bending vibrations of the O-Ti/Fe-O bonds in the oxygen octahedron. Raman modes near 333 cmE^{\u22121} are associated with the combined twisting and stretching vibrations of the oxygen octahedron , while the modes around 539 and 571 cmE^{\u22121} are related to the relative vibrations of the oxygen atom at the top outer end of the (Ti/Fe)O6 octahedron. The high-frequency mode appearing around 860 cmE^{\u22121} corresponds to the tensile vibrations of the TiO6 octahedron along the c-axis. After the introduction of ytterbium ions, the characteristic peaks mentioned above remain evident, suggesting that the ytterbium substitution does not significantly alter the basic structure of BTF. Notably, the high-frequency Raman modes located near 230 and 333 cmE^{\u22121} are intensified compared to the BTF, indicating the effect of ytterbium substitution on the distortion of the (Ti/Fe)O6 octahedron. This also suggests that ytterbium ions tend to replace bismuth ions, affecting the local structural environment around the BO6 octahedron, including changes in the phonon vibration frequency of the outer oxygen atom at the top of the (Ti/Fe)O6 octahedron and a reduction in local structural symmetry. Additionally, the positions and intensities of other Raman peaks show little change, indicating they are not significantly affected by the ytterbium ion replacement of bismuth ions. shows scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of natural surfaces for BTF-100xYb ceramics. All ceramic samples exhibit a compact, pore-free microstructure, indicating optimal sintering conditions for BTF-100xYb ceramics. The grains in all samples are well-developed, laminar, and randomly oriented, characteristic of BLSF ceramics. Due to the high grain growth rate perpendicular to the c-axis of BLSF crystals, the grain growth is structurally anisotropic, with the length of the plate-like grains significantly exceeding their thickness. Compared to BTF, the ytterbium-substituted BTF ceramics exhibit larger grain sizes, which are advantageous for enhancing piezoelectric properties. The average grain size of BTF increases significantly with increasing ytterbium content, demonstrating that the substitution of ytterbium improves mass diffusion and accelerates the migration of ions during the sintering process , thus facilitating the grain growth. This observation is consistent with recent reports on other BLSF compounds. Ceramics with low electrical resistivity can generate high leakage currents, leading to charge drift and interference with the detection of charges induced by the piezoelectric effect. (a) shows the temperature dependence of the dc electrical resistivity of BTF-100xYb ceramics. As shown in , the maximum resistivity values are observed for BTF-4Yb, measuring 2.4\xd710E^{7} \u03a9 cm at 300 \xb0C, 1.6\xd710E^{6} \u03a9 cm at 400 \xb0C, and 1.8\xd710E^{5} \u03a9 cm at 500 \xb0C. These values are higher than those of BTF, which are 8.8\xd710E^{6} \u03a9 cm at 300 \u2103, 5.6\xd710E^{5} \u03a9 cm at 400 \u2103, and 6.7\xd710E^{4} \u03a9 cm at 500 \u2103. The high dc electrical resistivity allows ytterbium-substituted BTF ceramics to withstand higher electric fields, enhancing their piezoelectric properties through sufficient polarization. The (Bi2O2)E^{2+} layers play a crucial role in space-charge compensation in Aurivillius-type compounds, improving electrical properties by suppressing leakage currents. Bismuth ions tend to volatilize during high-temperature sintering due to its relatively low melting point (\u223c820 \xb0C), leading to the formation of oxygen vacancies that act as charge carriers. The substitution of the highly volatile bismuth ions with ytterbium ions, which have a higher melting point (\u223c2346 \xb0C), can effectively suppress bismuth loss during sintering. This stabilization of the (Bi2O2)E^{2+} layers reduced the formation of point defects such as oxygen vacancies. In Aurivillius-type materials, grain growth is structurally anisotropic, occurring primarily in the a-b plane, while the (Bi2O2)E^{2+} layers along the c-axis act as natural insulating media. Larger grain sizes in ytterbium-substituted ceramics facilitate long-range charge transport due to reduced grain boundary effects and weaker insulation by the (Bi2O2)E^{2+} layers. This explains why the resistivity decreases with increasing ytterbium substitution, particularly in BTF-20Yb. The temperature-dependent resistivity behavior follows the Arrhenius relationship : \u03c1 = \u03c1 0 exp (E a/k B T), where \u03c1 0 is a pre-exponential factor, E a is the activation energy, k B is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute temperature. An activation energy of \u223c0.90 eV, typical for the migration enthalpy of oxygen, suggests that the electrical conduction process in BTF-100xYb ceramics is dominated by the oxygen vacancies. shows the dielectric constant (\u03b5 r) and dielectric loss (tan\u03b4) of BTF-100xYb measured at 1 MHz. The \u03b5 r of all samples increases gradually as the temperature rises from room temperature (RT) to 500 \xb0C. However, it increases sharply above 500 \xb0C due to high electrical conductivity. All samples exhibit a distinct peak in \u03b5 r, corresponding to the ferroelectric-to-paraelectric phase transition, i.e., the T C of the material. Although only one phase transition is observed in BTF-100xYb, BTF-20Yb shows a small bump around 600 \xb0C, attributed to space charge effects, which is consistent with observations in Co-doped BTF. As indicated in the inset of (a) and , T C values significantly increase with ytterbium substitution, due to the distortion of the BTF lattice caused by the introduction of ytterbium ions. The optimal composition, BTF-4Yb, has a T C of 771 \xb0C, and the maximum T C of 805 \xb0C is achieved for BTF-20Yb, which is 42 \xb0C higher than that of unmodified BTF (763 \xb0C). Previous studies have shown that T C values in BLSFs are strongly related to the degree of structural distortion , described by the tolerance factor (t), defined as t= R A+ R O 2( R B+ R O), where R A , R B , and R O are the ionic radii of A-site cations, B-site cations, and oxygen ions, respectively. According to Shannon\u2019s law , compared with BiE^{3+} (136 pm, CN = 12) at the A-site, the substitution of YbE^{3+} (115 pm, CN = 12) with a smaller ionic radius at the A-site leads to a decrease in t and an increase in T C. Similarly, as shown in (b), the tan\u03b4 increases gradually up to 500 \xb0C but rises sharply above 500 \xb0C due to high conductivity and thermally activated domain wall movements. Research suggests that oxygen vacancies (Vo..) resulting from bismuth volatilization during the calcination process act as space charges, leading to the domain pinning effect and increased tan\u03b4. However, the dielectric loss of BTF-4Yb ceramics is lower than 0.03 below 300 \xb0C, which is conducive to its application in high temperature scenarios. Benefitting from the slight lattice distortion, increased grain size, and reduced oxygen vacancy concentration induced by the introduction of ytterbium, the piezoelectric and electromechanical properties of BTF-100xYb ceramics are significantly improved. As listed in , the piezoelectric constant d 33 is prominently improved and shows a trend of first increasing and then decreasing with the increasing ytterbium substitution. The optimal piezoelectric performance with a maximum d 33 value of 21.4 pC/N is achieved by BTF-4Yb, which is more than three times that of the unmodified BTF of 7.1 pC/N. In addition, an enhanced planar frequency constant (N p) of 2096 Hz m, the optimal electromechanical coupling factor (k p) of 5.1 % and a mechanical quality factor (Q mp) of 2550 are obtained simultaneously in BTF-4Yb. lists the comparison of d 33 and T C of the reported BTF-based ceramics. In this work, a high d 33 of 21.4 pC/N with a large T C of 771 \u2103 is achieved in BTF-4Yb, which is superior to that of previous works. Based on these properties, it can be shown that ytterbium-substituted BTF ceramics are excellent candidates for high-temperature applications. To investigate the macroscopic ferroelectric behaviors of BTF-100xYb ceramics, (a) and (b) present the polarization-electric field (P-E) loops and electric current density-electric field (J-E) curves, measured at 160 kV/cm, 1 Hz, and 150 \xb0C. All BTF-100xYb ceramic samples exhibit typical ferroelectric P-E loops, indicating the formation of good ferroelectric properties. Compared to unmodified BTF, the P-E loop for BTF-4Yb shows more saturated states, while the P-E loops become slimmer and spindly as ytterbium content increases to 20 mol%. Compared to the unmodified BTF, the current peaks of ytterbium-substituted ceramics shift to higher electric fields. As listed in , the remanent polarization (P r) of the BTF-100xYb ceramics increases as x rises from 0 to 0.04, before decreasing as x increases further to 0.20, reaching its maximum for BTF-4Yb. The largest remnant polarization of BTF-4Yb suggests excellent piezoelectricity. For ytterbium-substituted BTF ceramics, the improvement in piezoelectric properties compared to unmodified BTF seems to be primarily due to slight lattice distortion, increased grain size, improved insulation, and reduced oxygen vacancy concentration. Additionally, it is worth noting that the symmetry of the P-E loop is not ideal (E c+ \u2260 E c-), which can be attributed to the presence of an internal bias field induced by an increase in the number of defective dipole pairs within the material. illustrates the thermal annealing behavior of BTF-100xYb ceramics to evaluate their piezoelectric performance after annealing treatment. In the low-annealing temperature range (< 300 \xb0C), the d 33 values show a slight decrease but retain more than 90 % of their original values due to thermally activated reverse switching in the non-180 \xb0 domains. As the temperature increases from 300 to 600 \xb0C, the d 33 values decrease more rapidly with higher ytterbium doping but still maintain above 80 % of their original values. However, the introduction of ytterbium stabilizes the (Bi2O2)E^{2+} layer and reduces the oxygen vacancy content, leading to a quicker decrease in d 33 values. Notably, the ytterbium-substituted ceramics retain a high piezoelectric constant (d 33 > 75 % of the original values) even after annealing at 700 \xb0C, whereas the unmodified BTF almost completely loses its piezoelectricity. To study the thermal stability of the piezoelectric performance in ytterbium-substituted BTF, we examined the temperature-dependent electrical impedance of BTF-4Yb, as shown in , where the frequency-dependent electromechanical resonance characteristics (k p mode) at elevated temperatures are shown. At room temperature, the resonance and antiresonance frequencies appear near 252 kHz but shift steadily toward lower frequencies with decreasing impedance amplitude as the temperature increases from 30 \xb0C to 500 \xb0C. At lower temperatures (T < 300 \xb0C), the electrical impedances of the resonance peaks and valleys are Z(f a) \u223c 22.2 k\u03a9 and Z(f r) \u223c 2.4 k\u03a9 at RT, and Z(f a) \u223c 5.4 k\u03a9 and Z(f r) \u223c 3.9 k\u03a9 at 300 \xb0C, respectively, showing a considerable contrast between Z(f a) and Z(f r). However, above 300 \xb0C, the resonance amplitude decreases sharply due to increased electrical conductivity. Despite the weak resonance/antiresonance amplitude at 500 \xb0C, the resonance characteristics are still evident, indicating that BTF-4Yb retains its piezoelectric nature up to 500 \xb0C. From RT to 300 \xb0C, both f r and f a shift almost linearly to lower frequencies with increasing temperature. However, above 300 \xb0C, the resonance frequency changes dramatically due to increased conductivity. The temperature coefficients of the resonance and antiresonance frequencies are found to be approximately 90 ppm/K. Despite high temperatures, BTF-4Yb retains its resonance characteristics. Nonetheless, BTF-4Yb demonstrates good thermal stability of piezoelectric properties, indicating its potential for high-temperature piezoelectric applications.

# ABSTRACT
Aurivillius-type bismuth layer-structured ferroelectric (BLSF) bismuth titanate-ferrite (Bi5Ti3FeO15) has recently received significant attention. However, the piezoelectric properties of Bi5Ti3FeO15-based compounds have not been extensively explored due to their poor piezoelectric performance and low direct-current (dc) electrical resistivity at elevated temperatures. We conducted a detailed examination of the crystal structure, microstructural morphology, and piezoelectric properties of ytterbium-substituted Bi5Ti3FeO15. The optimal composition, 4 mol% ytterbium-substituted Bi5Ti3FeO15 (BTF-4Yb), exhibits a significantly improved piezoelectric constant (d
                     33) of 21.4 pC/N, which is three times higher than that of Bi5Ti3FeO15 (7.1 pC/N). Additionally, it shows a high dc electrical resistivity of 1.6 MΩ cm at 400 °C and a high Curie temperature (T
                     C) of 771 °C. Importantly, BTF-4Yb maintains good thermal stability of electromechanical coupling characteristics up to 300 °C. These results indicate that ytterbium-substituted Bi5Ti3FeO15 is a promising candidate for high-temperature piezoelectric ceramics, offering significant potential for applications in high-temperature piezoelectric sensors.

# INTRODUCTION
Piezoelectric materials, which convert electrical energy into mechanical energy, are highly sought after for piezoelectric applications operating at elevated temperatures (\u2265 300 \u2103) to ensure structural health monitoring and diagnostics in fields such as automotive, aerospace, and power plants. Currently, lead zirconate titanate (PZT) piezoelectric ceramics with morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) compositions are the predominant choice due to their excellent electromechanical coupling properties. However, PZT ceramics are unsuitable for high-temperature applications due to their relatively low Curie temperature (T C < 400 \u2103). Since piezoelectric materials can only be safely used up to approximately half of their T C without significant performance degradation, PZT ceramics are not viable for applications exceeding 250 \u2103. Aurivillius-type bismuth layer-structured ferroelectrics (BLSFs), such as CaBi2Nb2O9 (CBN) , Bi3TiNbO9 (BTN) , CaBi4Ti4O15 (CBT) , Bi4Ti3O12 (BIT) , Na0.5Bi2.5Nb2O9 (NBN) , have emerged as promising candidates for high-temperature applications due to their high T C exceeding 600 \u2103. The general formula for BLSF oxides is (Bi2O2)E^{2+}(A m-1 B m O3m+1)E^{2-}, where A represents monovalent, divalent, or trivalent metallic ions suitable for dodecahedral coordination, B represents tetravalent, pentavalent, or hexavalent transition metallic ions suitable for octahedral coordination, and m ranges from 1 to 5, indicating the number of octahedral layers in the perovskite slab. Despite their potential, BLSF compounds typically exhibit weak piezoelectric performance, generally piezoelectric constant (d 33) not exceeding 10 pC/N, due to high coercive fields (Ec ) and structural anisotropy. Additionally, BLSFs often suffer from low electrical resistivity, attributed to high concentrations of oxygen vacancies resulting from the volatilization of bismuth during sintering. To address these limitations, researchers have explored various methods to enhance the piezoelectric properties of BLSF compounds, such as chemical doping and grain orientation techniques. Bismuth titanate-ferrite (Bi5Ti3FeO15, BTF) with m = 4 stands out in the BLSF family as a promising high-temperature piezoelectric material, due to its high T C (\u223c761 \xb0C). While recent studies have focused on the electromagnetic and ferromagnetic coupling applications of BTF, there has been limited research on its piezoelectric properties. This is largely attributed to the material\u2019s rigid poling conditions, such as high E c and significant leakage currents. Nevertheless, chemical modification has proven to be a cost-effective strategy for simultaneously enhancing the piezoelectric properties and electrical resistivity of BTF, paving the way for large-scale manufacturing. For example, Moure et al. reported an enhanced d 33 of 18.6 pC/N in Bi5Ti3FeO15-CaBi4Ti4O15 (BTF-CBT) ; Huang et al. achieved a d 33 of 13.4 pC/N in (Na, Ce) co-modified BTF ; and Wang et al. attained a high d 33 of 23 pC/N in Mn-modified BTF. However, there is a paucity of studies on the effects of A-site rare-earth ion substitutions on the piezoelectric properties and thermal stability of BTF. In this study, we propose a strategy involving A-site substitution with ytterbium (Yb) to stabilize the (Bi2O2)E^{2+} layer and reduce the concentration of oxygen vacancies. This approach aims to enhance both the piezoelectric properties and thermal stability of BTF. We thoroughly investigate the structure, dielectric, electrical, piezoelectric, and electromechanical properties of A-site ytterbium-substituted BTF.

# CONCLUSION
Bismuth layer-structured ferroelectric Bi5Ti3FeO15 ceramics with rare-earth ytterbium ion substitutions were synthesized using the conventional solid-state reaction method. We thoroughly investigated the structural, dielectric, electrical, piezoelectric, and electromechanical properties of A-site ytterbium-substituted Bi5Ti3FeO15. The piezoelectric constant (d 33) was significantly enhanced by substituting ytterbium ions for bismuth ions, with BTF-4Yb exhibiting the optimal piezoelectric performance (d 33 = 21.4 pC/N), which is three times greater than that of BTF. The Curie temperature (T C) values slightly increased with higher ytterbium content due to the lattice distortion of the BTF caused by substituting smaller radius ytterbium ions for bismuth ions. Temperature-dependent dc electrical resistivity measurements demonstrated that proper ytterbium introduction can improve dc electrical resistivity, with BTF-4Yb showing the highest dc electrical resistivity among all the compositions. The thermal annealing behavior of BTF-100xYb ceramics indicates that ytterbium-substituted BTF ceramics have potential for high-temperature applications. Additionally, the temperature-dependent electrical impedance, resonance frequency, and anti-resonance frequency measurements show that BTF-4Yb maintains good thermal stability of electromechanical properties. These findings suggest that ytterbium-substituted BTF ceramics are promising materials for high-temperature piezoelectric applications.
