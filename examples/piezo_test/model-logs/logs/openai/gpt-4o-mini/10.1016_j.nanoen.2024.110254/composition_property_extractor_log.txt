# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
As shown in -a(i), we consider a piezoelectric swimming microrobot that is driven by an AC voltage source at its thickness-mode resonance, where the robot generates an acoustic radiation force (F ARF) into a water medium, and the piezoelectric element is in direct contact with water. Using the converse piezoelectric effect, the piezoelectric disk vibrates in response to an applied AC in the thickness direction, where the disk is considered to be resonating in thickness-mode. As a result of the vibration of the piezoelectric material, an acoustic radiation pressure is formed at the interface between the piezoelectric material and the water medium, where, where p inter is the acoustic pressure amplitude at the interface, \u03c1 water and c water are the density of water and the acoustic wave speed in water, respectively. The terms \u03c9 and A are the angular speed and amplitude of the vibration, respectively. The acoustic radiation pressure is then transmitted to the surrounding water and the piezoelectric material by oscillating the medium (piezoelectric or water) at a particle velocity (u i). where t is time and x is the position along the vibration direction, with x=0 representing the position of the piezoelectric-water interface. When the acoustic wave is transmitting, the acoustic pressure (p i) in the water (p water) and the piezoelectric material (p piezo) is represented by,  Using the particle speed (u i) and the acoustic pressure (p i), the kinetic energy density (K i) and the potential energy density (U i) of the water and the piezoelectric material due to the acoustic radiation pressure can be obtained:  Therefore, the acoustic radiation pressure P i in the water and the piezoelectric material can be calculated as,  Due to the difference between the acoustic radiation pressure in the water P water and the piezoelectric P piezo, the resulting acoustic radiation force F ARF is given by: where S is the area of the vibrating surface of the piezoelectric material. As the acoustic radiation force F ARF and the acoustic radiation propulsion force (F Prop) are produced simultaneously, then:  Since the F Prop is highly correlated to a variety of properties of the piezoelectric material, including its density, piezoelectric d 33 strain coefficient and elastic modulus, we now examine how the introduction of porosity can used to tailor the magnitude of the F Prop. To achieve a high vibration amplitude (A), the piezoelectric element is typically operated at its resonance frequency (f 0). Since the acoustic pressure amplitude at the interface (p inter) is proportional to the angular speed of the vibration (\u03c9), as shown in , the AC voltage frequency should match the thickness-mode resonance frequency, f 0, of the piezoelectric element. For a piezoelectric disk, f 0 can be expressed as where h is the thickness of the piezoelectric disk, and Y and \u03c1 are the Young\u2019s modulus and density of the piezoelectric material, respectively. As a result, the introduction of porosity can affect the resonant frequency of the piezoelectric material by changing both Y and \u03c1, which thereby affects the acoustic radiation force (F Prop). The influence of porosity volume fraction on ceramic density (\u03c1) has a simple linear correlation, while its impact on the stuffiness (Y) is non-linear. Herein, the model proposed by Boccaccini et al. is used to describe the change in Y with the introduction of randomly distributed pores into the piezoelectric ceramic, as shown in (b) and once the impact of porosity on density and stiffness is known, can be used to determine the influence of porosity volume fraction on resonant frequency, f 0. (b) shows that the introduction of porosity reduces the resonant frequency since it reduces the elastic modulus to a greater extent than the material density. We now consider the impact of porosity on the strain when the piezoelectric disk vibrates at resonance at its thickness mode, where the vibration amplitude (A) can be assumed to be correlated to the longitudinal piezoelectric constant (d 33), which is a measure of the strain per unit electric field, where V is the AC voltage amplitude applied across the piezoelectric element. As shown in (c), the dependence of d 33 on porosity volume is described by a fitting formula based on experimental results from piezoelectric ceramics containing randomly distributed pores in Ref.. It can be seen that the introduction of porosity leads to a non-linear decrease in the d 33 with increasing pore volume fraction since the introduction of pores into the piezoelectric materials reduces the level of polarization. On considering the effect of porosity on d 33, an increase in porosity volume fraction leads to a decrease in the F Prop of the robot, see (c). The acoustic impedance (Z) describes the resistance to the propagation of acoustic waves through the medium, which is defined as the product of the density (\u03c1) and the acoustic velocity (c) of the medium :  For solid materials, such as the piezoelectric ceramics used here, the acoustic velocity (c piezo) can be expressed by the bulk modulus (B) and density (\u03c1) as  For homogeneous materials, B=Y/ 3(1\u22122\u03bd); where \u03bd is the Poisson\u2019s ratio. The introduction of porosity into the active piezoelectric element clearly has an inter-dependent influence on the F Prop generated by the robot; this a decrease in the resonance frequency (f 0), vibration amplitude (A) and acoustic impedance (Z piezo). Among them, a reduction in resonant frequency, f 0, and vibration amplitude, A, due to the introduction of porosity can be considered undesirable in terms of reducing F Prop. On considering the impact of porosity on all three parameters, the overall influence of porosity on F Prop is shown in (e), in which the F Prop can be observed to increase significantly with increasing porosity volume until the porosity volume reaches a relatively high level of \u223c80 vol%; the observed decrease in F Prop at pore fractions above 80 vol% is primarily a result of the very low d 33 coefficients and low amplitude at these high pore volume fractions, see (c). In summary, the modelling has shown that a porous piezoelectric with a porosity level lower than 80 vol% which exhibits a low acoustic impedance can enable a swimming micro-robot to achieve a high F Prop, exceeding that of a robot manufactured using dense piezoelectric materials. This is now experimentally validated in the following discussion and subsequent experimental characterisation. (b) shows scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the cross section of the porous BCZT ceramic, where the freezing direction is indicated. The freeze cast material exhibited a lamellar porous structure, where the pores are clearly aligned in the freezing direction; the porosity volume fraction was 49.5 % and the polarization direction along the direction in freezing. In addition, the computed tomographic (CT) image provides a 3D visualization of the porous BCZT, as shown in (c), where the vertically aligned pores introduced by the directional freezing of water can be observed. The freeze-casting process therefore successfully introduced a 2\u20132 porous structure into the BCZT ceramics. The dense BCZT fabricated by conventional uniaxial cold-pressing and sintering has a low porosity volume fraction of 1.4 %. The measured properties of both the dense and porous BCZT are summarized in , which include the density, porosity fraction, Young\u2019s modulus, relative permittivity at constant stress, and dielectric loss. The elastic modulus of the piezoelectric material, Y, was obtained from the electromechanical coupling coefficient (k t 2) as, where \u03b5 0 is permittivity of free space and \u03b5 33 \u03c3 is the relative permittivity at constant stress. Due to the introduction of porosity, there was a significant reduction in the relative permittivity at constant stress (\u03b5 33 \u03c3) and the Young\u2019s modulus (Y) of the BCZT. No significant change was observed in the dielectric loss (tan \u03b4) with the introduction of porosity. It is interesting to note that, after poling of the material along the freezing direction, the porous BCZT ceramic exhibited a longitudinal piezoelectric constant (d 33) that was higher than that of the dense BCZT; this has been recently observed for other porous BCZT ceramics. As a result of the high d 33 , the porous BCZT exhibited a high calculated electromechanical coupling coefficient at its thickness-mode (k t 2). The cross section of the nanocellulose aerogel was examined by SEM, see (e), indicating a distance of \u223c100 \u03bcm between adjacent pore walls of the aerogel, and the CT image in (f) provides a 3D visualization of the nanocellulose aerogel, which exhibits a 2\u20132 porous lamella structure. The microstructure of the pore wall was further characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM), see (d). The hydrophobic and oleophilic properties were examined, and (h) shows that the aerogel exhibited excellent hydrophobic properties due to a high contact angle of 142\xb0, which was maintained on the material surface for over 120 s. In contrast, the aerogels displayed desirable oleophilic properties as shown in (i), in which an oil droplet applied to the material surface was gradually absorbed in 70 s and completely absorbed in 140 s. On applying an AC voltage across the piezoelectric element, it is able to vibrate and resonate in its thickness direction. Interestingly, the lower frequency radial mode (\u223c 0.4 MHz) indicates some damping by the robot housing, and this is likely to be due to clamping of the piezoelectric at its edges as it attempts to achieve radial resonance. As shown in (a), for the dense BCZT ceramics, the modulus of electrical impedance, Z, decreased with increasing frequency. The low frequency resonance peaks for the dense BCZT ceramic that are observed below 1 MHz are due to the radial resonance mode, and its third harmonic. The thickness-mode resonance of the piezoelectric element can be observed at a higher frequency of \u223c 2.28 MHz, where the electric impedance decreased to the minimum value at the resonance frequency and then increased to the maximum at the anti-resonance frequency. Using the same method, the frequency dependence of the electric impedance of the porous BCZT ceramic was measured, as shown in (b). In this case, no peaks associated with the radial resonance was observed below 1 MHz; this was due to the introduction of aligned porosity in the ceramic structure introducing significant damping in the radial direction that is perpendicular to the direction of the aligned porosity. Since the piezoelectric phase in the porous BCZT was aligned in the thickness direction due to the directional freezing, a clear thickness-mode resonance peak could be observed at \u223c 1.47 MHz. The reduction in the resonance frequency, compared to the dense material of the same thickness, is a result of the lower Young\u2019s modulus of the material due to the presence of porosity, see Eq. 1(b) and Eq. (11), which also reduces the acoustic wave velocity in the material. Only small differences were observed in the resonance frequency and the impedance amplitude in both the dense and porous BCZT ceramics, which may be due to the clamping effects of robot housing and water on the piezoelectric element. For example, (a) shows the data for the microrobot based on a porous BCZT ceramic that is subjected to an AC voltage with a voltage amplitude of 25 V at a frequency of 1.47 MHz as a result of the generation of an acoustic propulsion force, the robot moved along the tank with the displacement gradually increasing time. As a result, information on the displacement and speed of the robot at any time point could be extracted, as shown in (b) and (c), respectively; a video of the whole swimming event under 25 V at 1.47 MHz is provided in supplementary information. The distance moved by the swimming microrobots based on dense and porous BCZT ceramics for a range of applied voltage amplitudes are shown in (a) and (b), respectively. For comparison, the distance moved by the robot at the time of 2 s is marked, where the displacement increased with the applied voltage for the robots. In addition, the displacement of the swimming robot based on porous BCZT was larger than that of the dense BCZT. For example, at 2 s, the displacements of the robot based on the dense material at voltage amplitudes of 10, 20, and 30 V were 1.5 cm, 4.1 cm, and 7.4 cm, respectively. While for the porous BCZT for the same applied voltage, the distance moved was 2.7 cm, 9.0 cm, and 14.3 cm, respectively. This indicates that the robot using the porous BCZT ceramic moved faster than the robot based on dense BCZT. During the measurement of the swimming speed, the robot is assumed to be accelerated by a F prop that is generated by the AC voltage source. Simultaneously, the robot is assumed to be affected by the tensile drag due to the electrical wires (F wire) and an additional drag due to water (F water); this is described below, where m is the mass of the robot and x\u0308 is the acceleration of the robot. F water is considered to be a damping force, which is proportional to the speed of the robot (x\u0307) as described by, where r is the equivalent damping force coefficient of water. By substituting into , the displacement, x, of the robot can be determined as a function of time (t) as below. where A 0 is a constant, and \u03b4 is the phase angle between the x and the x\u0307. By substituting the m,x and t into , the remaining parameters can be determined by fitting; these include A 0, c, r, \u03b4 and F prop. The F prop obtained for the robots is shown in (b) as a function of the amplitude of the applied AC voltage, where it can be seen that the F propof the robots increased with the applied voltage. It can be seen in (b) that for the same applied voltage, the robot based on the porous BCZT exhibited a propulsion force, F prop, that was approximately twice as high as that of the robot with the dense BCZT. Therefore, such an improvement in the F prop for the porous BCZT is primarily due to the reduced acoustic impedance and lower piezoelectric element mass. The amplitude of the required driving current (I 0), for a given driving voltage (V 0 ), can be calculated via , where f 0 is the resonance frequency of the piezoelectric element, and C is the capacitance of the piezoelectric element. The power required for a given (V 0 ) is where P ave is a time-average power of the regular charging process of the BCZT ceramics from zero volts to V 0. Since the introduction of porosity reduces both the resonance frequency f 0 ((b) and ) and the device capacitance C (due to the lower permittivity, ), the porous BCZT ceramic required a smaller driving current and power compared to those of the dense counterpart. Specifically, at the driving voltage of 25 V, the driving current amplitude (I 0) and average power (P ave) for the porous ceramic were \u223c200 mA and \u223c4.6 W, while those were \u223c600 mA and 13.4 W for the dense counterpart, see (c). While a direct comparison is difficult since the working conditions (such as dimensions, voltage, frequency etc.) are different, the porous BCZT compares favourably compared to other robots.

# TITLE
Enhanced buoyancy and propulsion in 3D printed swimming micro-robots based on a hydrophobic nano-fibrillated cellulose aerogel and porous lead-free piezoelectric ceramics

# ABSTRACT
Detailed characterisation and modelling of the swimming robots demonstrated that a swimming robot based on a lead-free porous Ba0.85Ca0.15Zr0.1Ti0.9O3 (BCZT) ceramic exhibited a higher acoustic radiation propulsion force and a faster swimming speed compared to a robot fabricated using a dense ceramic element.

# INTRODUCTION
As an alternative approach, piezoelectric materials are being considered whereby propulsion is achieved by a process of water jetting or the generation of surface acoustic waves (SAWs) and bulk acoustic waves (BAWs). The range of piezoelectric materials examined to date for such applications include ferroelectric materials, such as lead zirconate titanate , lithium niobate , and (Bi, Na, Ba)(Ti, Mn)O3 in bulk or thin film form. One challenge of using piezoelectric ceramics is their high acoustic impedance (Z = \u03c1B, where \u03c1 is the density and B is the bulk modulus), which is much higher than that of water due to the high density and stiffness of the piezoelectric ceramic. The porosity of the lightweight nanofibrillated cellulose aerogel can be as high as 97 %. The overall structure of the robot and the housing based on 3D printing are initially introduced, and processing of the nanocellulose and the resulting hydrophobic and oleophilic properties are then investigated in detail.

# CONCLUSION
The nanocellulose aerogel exhibited excellent hydrophobic properties due to a high contact angle (142\xb0), which was maintained on the material surface for extended periods of time to provide long-term operation. A new analysis model was developed to quantify the benefits of introducing porosity into the active Ba0.85Ca0.15Zr0.1Ti0.9O3 (BCZT) piezoelectric element and inform materials design, namely, to decrease the acoustic impedance of the material and lower the overall mass, while also maintaining the piezoelectric strain and thickness-mode resonance. Detailed characterisation and analysis of the swimming robots that were manufactured by 3D printing demonstrate that a swimming robot based on the porous BCZT exhibited a faster swim speed and a larger acoustic radiation propulsion force compared to a robot fabricated from the dense BCZT element. The use of a porous BCZT element was also shown to reduce the driving current and power requirements as a result of (i) the lower resonant frequency due to the lower stiffness and density of the piezoelectric, and (ii) a lower total device capacitance due to the lower permittivity of the porous material. The ability of the low acoustic impedance porous BCZT to achieve an improved propulsion force via a thickness mode resonance also indicates potential for use as an active piezoelectric element where acoustic impedance matching is highly desirable, such as ultrasonic transducers for medical and non-destructive evaluation applications.

To achieve a high vibration amplitude (A), the piezoelectric element is typically operated at its resonance frequency (f 0). Since the acoustic pressure amplitude at the interface (p inter) is proportional to the angular speed of the vibration (\u03c9), as shown in , the AC voltage frequency should match the thickness-mode resonance frequency, f 0, of the piezoelectric element. For a piezoelectric disk, f 0 can be expressed as where h is the thickness of the piezoelectric disk, and Y and \u03c1 are the Young\u2019s modulus and density of the piezoelectric material, respectively. As a result, the introduction of porosity can affect the resonant frequency of the piezoelectric material by changing both Y and \u03c1, which thereby affects the acoustic radiation force (F Prop).

As shown in (c), the dependence of d 33 on porosity volume is described by a fitting formula based on experimental results from piezoelectric ceramics containing randomly distributed pores in Ref.. It can be seen that the introduction of porosity leads to a non-linear decrease in the d 33 with increasing pore volume fraction since the introduction of pores into the piezoelectric materials reduces the level of polarization.

Among them, a reduction in resonant frequency, f 0, and vibration amplitude, A, due to the introduction of porosity can be considered undesirable in terms of reducing F Prop. On considering the impact of porosity on all three parameters, the overall influence of porosity on F Prop is shown in (e), in which the F Prop can be observed to increase significantly with increasing porosity volume until the porosity volume reaches a relatively high level of \u223c80 vol%; the observed decrease in F Prop at pore fractions above 80 vol% is primarily a result of the very low d 33 coefficients and low amplitude at these high pore volume fractions, see (c). In summary, the modelling has shown that a porous piezoelectric with a porosity level lower than 80 vol% which exhibits a low acoustic impedance can enable a swimming micro-robot to achieve a high F Prop, exceeding that of a robot manufactured using dense piezoelectric materials. This is now experimentally validated in the following discussion and subsequent experimental characterisation. (b) shows scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the cross section of the porous BCZT ceramic, where the freezing direction is indicated. The freeze cast material exhibited a lamellar porous structure, where the pores are clearly aligned in the freezing direction; the porosity volume fraction was 49.5 % and the polarization direction along the direction in freezing. In addition, the computed tomographic (CT) image provides a 3D visualization of the porous BCZT, as shown in (c), where the vertically aligned pores introduced by the directional freezing of water can be observed. The freeze-casting process therefore successfully introduced a 2\u20132 porous structure into the BCZT ceramics. The dense BCZT fabricated by conventional uniaxial cold-pressing and sintering has a low porosity volume fraction of 1.4 %. The measured properties of both the dense and porous BCZT are summarized in , which include the density, porosity fraction, Young\u2019s modulus, relative permittivity at constant stress, and dielectric loss. The elastic modulus of the piezoelectric material, Y, was obtained from the electromechanical coupling coefficient (k t 2) as, where \u03b5 0 is permittivity of free space and \u03b5 33 \u03c3 is the relative permittivity at constant stress. Due to the introduction of porosity, there was a significant reduction in the relative permittivity at constant stress (\u03b5 33 \u03c3) and the Young\u2019s modulus (Y) of the BCZT. No significant change was observed in the dielectric loss (tan \u03b4) with the introduction of porosity. It is interesting to note that, after poling of the material along the freezing direction, the porous BCZT ceramic exhibited a longitudinal piezoelectric constant (d 33) that was higher than that of the dense BCZT; this has been recently observed for other porous BCZT ceramics. As a result of the high d 33 , the porous BCZT exhibited a high calculated electromechanical coupling coefficient at its thickness-mode (k t 2). The cross section of the nanocellulose aerogel was examined by SEM, see (e), indicating a distance of \u223c100 \u03bcm between adjacent pore walls of the aerogel, and the CT image in (f) provides a 3D visualization of the nanocellulose aerogel, which exhibits a 2\u20132 porous lamella structure. The microstructure of the pore wall was further characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM), see (d). The hydrophobic and oleophilic properties were examined, and (h) shows that the aerogel exhibited excellent hydrophobic properties due to a high contact angle of 142\xb0, which was maintained on the material surface for over 120 s. In contrast, the aerogels displayed desirable oleophilic properties as shown in (i), in which an oil droplet applied to the material surface was gradually absorbed in 70 s and completely absorbed in 140 s. On applying an AC voltage across the piezoelectric element, it is able to vibrate and resonate in its thickness direction. Interestingly, the lower frequency radial mode (\u223c 0.4 MHz) indicates some damping by the robot housing, and this is likely to be due to clamping of the piezoelectric at its edges as it attempts to achieve radial resonance. As shown in (a), for the dense BCZT ceramics, the modulus of electrical impedance, Z, decreased with increasing frequency. The low frequency resonance peaks for the dense BCZT ceramic that are observed below 1 MHz are due to the radial resonance mode, and its third harmonic. The thickness-mode resonance of the piezoelectric element can be observed at a higher frequency of \u223c 2.28 MHz, where the electric impedance decreased to the minimum value at the resonance frequency and then increased to the maximum at the anti-resonance frequency. Using the same method, the frequency dependence of the electric impedance of the porous BCZT ceramic was measured, as shown in (b). In this case, no peaks associated with the radial resonance was observed below 1 MHz; this was due to the introduction of aligned porosity in the ceramic structure introducing significant damping in the radial direction that is perpendicular to the direction of the aligned porosity. Since the piezoelectric phase in the porous BCZT was aligned in the thickness direction due to the directional freezing, a clear thickness-mode resonance peak could be observed at \u223c 1.47 MHz. The reduction in the resonance frequency, compared to the dense material of the same thickness, is a result of the lower Young\u2019s modulus of the material due to the presence of porosity, see Eq. 1(b) and Eq. (11), which also reduces the acoustic wave velocity in the material. Only small differences were observed in the resonance frequency and the impedance amplitude in both the dense and porous BCZT ceramics, which may be due to the clamping effects of robot housing and water on the piezoelectric element. For example, (a) shows the data for the microrobot based on a porous BCZT ceramic that is subjected to an AC voltage with a voltage amplitude of 25 V at a frequency of 1.47 MHz as a result of the generation of an acoustic propulsion force, the robot moved along the tank with the displacement gradually increasing time. As a result, information on the displacement and speed of the robot at any time point could be extracted, as shown in (b) and (c), respectively; a video of the whole swimming event under 25 V at 1.47 MHz is provided in supplementary information. The distance moved by the swimming microrobots based on dense and porous BCZT ceramics for a range of applied voltage amplitudes are shown in (a) and (b), respectively. For comparison, the distance moved by the robot at the time of 2 s is marked, where the displacement increased with the applied voltage for the robots. In addition, the displacement of the swimming robot based on porous BCZT was larger than that of the dense BCZT. For example, at 2 s, the displacements of the robot based on the dense material at voltage amplitudes of 10, 20, and 30 V were 1.5 cm, 4.1 cm, and 7.4 cm, respectively. While for the porous BCZT for the same applied voltage, the distance moved was 2.7 cm, 9.0 cm, and 14.3 cm, respectively. This indicates that the robot using the porous BCZT ceramic moved faster than the robot based on dense BCZT. During the measurement of the swimming speed, the robot is assumed to be accelerated by a F prop that is generated by the AC voltage source. Simultaneously, the robot is assumed to be affected by the tensile drag due to the electrical wires (F wire) and an additional drag due to water (F water); this is described below, where m is the mass of the robot and x\u0308 is the acceleration of the robot. F water is considered to be a damping force, which is proportional to the speed of the robot (x\u0307) as described by, where r is the equivalent damping force coefficient of water. By substituting into , the displacement, x, of the robot can be determined as a function of time (t) as below. where A 0 is a constant, and \u03b4 is the phase angle between the x and the x\u0307. By substituting the m,x and t into , the remaining parameters can be determined by fitting; these include A 0, c, r, \u03b4 and F prop. The F prop obtained for the robots is shown in (b) as a function of the amplitude of the applied AC voltage, where it can be seen that the F propof the robots increased with the applied voltage. It can be seen in (b) that for the same applied voltage, the robot based on the porous BCZT exhibited a propulsion force, F prop, that was approximately twice as high as that of the robot with the dense BCZT. Therefore, such an improvement in the F prop for the porous BCZT is primarily due to the reduced acoustic impedance and lower piezoelectric element mass. The amplitude of the required driving current (I 0), for a given driving voltage (V 0 ), can be calculated via , where f 0 is the resonance frequency of the piezoelectric element, and C is the capacitance of the piezoelectric element. The power required for a given (V 0 ) is where P ave is a time-average power of the regular charging process of the BCZT ceramics from zero volts to V 0. Since the introduction of porosity reduces both the resonance frequency f 0 ((b) and ) and the device capacitance C (due to the lower permittivity, ), the porous BCZT ceramic required a smaller driving current and power compared to those of the dense counterpart. Specifically, at the driving voltage of 25 V, the driving current amplitude (I 0) and average power (P ave) for the porous ceramic were \u223c200 mA and \u223c4.6 W, while those were \u223c600 mA and 13.4 W for the dense counterpart, see (c). While a direct comparison is difficult since the working conditions (such as dimensions, voltage, frequency etc.) are different, the porous BCZT compares favourably compared to other robots.

# TITLE
Enhanced buoyancy and propulsion in 3D printed swimming micro-robots based on a hydrophobic nano-fibrillated cellulose aerogel and porous lead-free piezoelectric ceramics

# ABSTRACT
Detailed characterisation and modelling of the swimming robots demonstrated that a swimming robot based on a lead-free porous Ba0.85Ca0.15Zr0.1Ti0.9O3 (BCZT) ceramic exhibited a higher acoustic radiation propulsion force and a faster swimming speed compared to a robot fabricated using a dense ceramic element.

# INTRODUCTION
As an alternative approach, piezoelectric materials are being considered whereby propulsion is achieved by a process of water jetting or the generation of surface acoustic waves (SAWs) and bulk acoustic waves (BAWs). The range of piezoelectric materials examined to date for such applications include ferroelectric materials, such as lead zirconate titanate , lithium niobate , and (Bi, Na, Ba)(Ti, Mn)O3 in bulk or thin film form. One challenge of using piezoelectric ceramics is their high acoustic impedance (Z = \u03c1B, where \u03c1 is the density and B is the bulk modulus), which is much higher than that of water due to the high density and stiffness of the piezoelectric ceramic. The porosity of the lightweight nanofibrillated cellulose aerogel can be as high as 97 %. The overall structure of the robot and the housing based on 3D printing are initially introduced, and processing of the nanocellulose and the resulting hydrophobic and oleophilic properties are then investigated in detail.

# CONCLUSION
The nanocellulose aerogel exhibited excellent hydrophobic properties due to a high contact angle (142\xb0), which was maintained on the material surface for extended periods of time to provide long-term operation. A new analysis model was developed to quantify the benefits of introducing porosity into the active Ba0.85Ca0.15Zr0.1Ti0.9O3 (BCZT) piezoelectric element and inform materials design, namely, to decrease the acoustic impedance of the material and lower the overall mass, while also maintaining the piezoelectric strain and thickness-mode resonance. Detailed characterisation and analysis of the swimming robots that were manufactured by 3D printing demonstrate that a swimming robot based on the porous BCZT exhibited a faster swim speed and a larger acoustic radiation propulsion force compared to a robot fabricated from the dense BCZT element. The use of a porous BCZT element was also shown to reduce the driving current and power requirements as a result of (i) the lower resonant frequency due to the lower stiffness and density of the piezoelectric, and (ii) a lower total device capacitance due to the lower permittivity of the porous material. The ability of the low acoustic impedance porous BCZT to achieve an improved propulsion force via a thickness mode resonance also indicates potential for use as an active piezoelectric element where acoustic impedance matching is highly desirable, such as ultrasonic transducers for medical and non-destructive evaluation applications.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
As shown in -a(i), we consider a piezoelectric swimming microrobot that is driven by an AC voltage source at its thickness-mode resonance, where the robot generates an acoustic radiation force (F ARF) into a water medium, and the piezoelectric element is in direct contact with water. Using the converse piezoelectric effect, the piezoelectric disk vibrates in response to an applied AC in the thickness direction, where the disk is considered to be resonating in thickness-mode. As a result of the vibration of the piezoelectric material, an acoustic radiation pressure is formed at the interface between the piezoelectric material and the water medium, where, where p inter is the acoustic pressure amplitude at the interface, \u03c1 water and c water are the density of water and the acoustic wave speed in water, respectively. The terms \u03c9 and A are the angular speed and amplitude of the vibration, respectively. The acoustic radiation pressure is then transmitted to the surrounding water and the piezoelectric material by oscillating the medium (piezoelectric or water) at a particle velocity (u i). where t is time and x is the position along the vibration direction, with x=0 representing the position of the piezoelectric-water interface. When the acoustic wave is transmitting, the acoustic pressure (p i) in the water (p water) and the piezoelectric material (p piezo) is represented by,  Using the particle speed (u i) and the acoustic pressure (p i), the kinetic energy density (K i) and the potential energy density (U i) of the water and the piezoelectric material due to the acoustic radiation pressure can be obtained:  Therefore, the acoustic radiation pressure P i in the water and the piezoelectric material can be calculated as,  Due to the difference between the acoustic radiation pressure in the water P water and the piezoelectric P piezo, the resulting acoustic radiation force F ARF is given by: where S is the area of the vibrating surface of the piezoelectric material. As the acoustic radiation force F ARF and the acoustic radiation propulsion force (F Prop) are produced simultaneously, then:  Since the F Prop is highly correlated to a variety of properties of the piezoelectric material, including its density, piezoelectric d 33 strain coefficient and elastic modulus, we now examine how the introduction of porosity can used to tailor the magnitude of the F Prop. To achieve a high vibration amplitude (A), the piezoelectric element is typically operated at its resonance frequency (f 0). Since the acoustic pressure amplitude at the interface (p inter) is proportional to the angular speed of the vibration (\u03c9), as shown in , the AC voltage frequency should match the thickness-mode resonance frequency, f 0, of the piezoelectric element. For a piezoelectric disk, f 0 can be expressed as where h is the thickness of the piezoelectric disk, and Y and \u03c1 are the Young\u2019s modulus and density of the piezoelectric material, respectively. As a result, the introduction of porosity can affect the resonant frequency of the piezoelectric material by changing both Y and \u03c1, which thereby affects the acoustic radiation force (F Prop). The influence of porosity volume fraction on ceramic density (\u03c1) has a simple linear correlation, while its impact on the stuffiness (Y) is non-linear. Herein, the model proposed by Boccaccini et al. is used to describe the change in Y with the introduction of randomly distributed pores into the piezoelectric ceramic, as shown in (b) and once the impact of porosity on density and stiffness is known, can be used to determine the influence of porosity volume fraction on resonant frequency, f 0. (b) shows that the introduction of porosity reduces the resonant frequency since it reduces the elastic modulus to a greater extent than the material density. We now consider the impact of porosity on the strain when the piezoelectric disk vibrates at resonance at its thickness mode, where the vibration amplitude (A) can be assumed to be correlated to the longitudinal piezoelectric constant (d 33), which is a measure of the strain per unit electric field, where V is the AC voltage amplitude applied across the piezoelectric element. As shown in (c), the dependence of d 33 on porosity volume is described by a fitting formula based on experimental results from piezoelectric ceramics containing randomly distributed pores in Ref.. It can be seen that the introduction of porosity leads to a non-linear decrease in the d 33 with increasing pore volume fraction since the introduction of pores into the piezoelectric materials reduces the level of polarization. On considering the effect of porosity on d 33, an increase in porosity volume fraction leads to a decrease in the F Prop of the robot, see (c). The acoustic impedance (Z) describes the resistance to the propagation of acoustic waves through the medium, which is defined as the product of the density (\u03c1) and the acoustic velocity (c) of the medium :  For solid materials, such as the piezoelectric ceramics used here, the acoustic velocity (c piezo) can be expressed by the bulk modulus (B) and density (\u03c1) as  For homogeneous materials, B=Y/ 3(1\u22122\u03bd); where \u03bd is the Poisson\u2019s ratio. The introduction of porosity into the active piezoelectric element clearly has an inter-dependent influence on the F Prop generated by the robot; this a decrease in the resonance frequency (f 0), vibration amplitude (A) and acoustic impedance (Z piezo). Among them, a reduction in resonant frequency, f 0, and vibration amplitude, A, due to the introduction of porosity can be considered undesirable in terms of reducing F Prop. On considering the impact of porosity on all three parameters, the overall influence of porosity on F Prop is shown in (e), in which the F Prop can be observed to increase significantly with increasing porosity volume until the porosity volume reaches a relatively high level of \u223c80 vol%; the observed decrease in F Prop at pore fractions above 80 vol% is primarily a result of the very low d 33 coefficients and low amplitude at these high pore volume fractions, see (c). In summary, the modelling has shown that a porous piezoelectric with a porosity level lower than 80 vol% which exhibits a low acoustic impedance can enable a swimming micro-robot to achieve a high F Prop, exceeding that of a robot manufactured using dense piezoelectric materials. This is now experimentally validated in the following discussion and subsequent experimental characterisation. (b) shows scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the cross section of the porous BCZT ceramic, where the freezing direction is indicated. The freeze cast material exhibited a lamellar porous structure, where the pores are clearly aligned in the freezing direction; the porosity volume fraction was 49.5 % and the polarization direction along the direction in freezing. In addition, the computed tomographic (CT) image provides a 3D visualization of the porous BCZT, as shown in (c), where the vertically aligned pores introduced by the directional freezing of water can be observed. The freeze-casting process therefore successfully introduced a 2\u20132 porous structure into the BCZT ceramics. The dense BCZT fabricated by conventional uniaxial cold-pressing and sintering has a low porosity volume fraction of 1.4 %. The measured properties of both the dense and porous BCZT are summarized in , which include the density, porosity fraction, Young\u2019s modulus, relative permittivity at constant stress, and dielectric loss. The elastic modulus of the piezoelectric material, Y, was obtained from the electromechanical coupling coefficient (k t 2) as, where \u03b5 0 is permittivity of free space and \u03b5 33 \u03c3 is the relative permittivity at constant stress. Due to the introduction of porosity, there was a significant reduction in the relative permittivity at constant stress (\u03b5 33 \u03c3) and the Young\u2019s modulus (Y) of the BCZT. No significant change was observed in the dielectric loss (tan \u03b4) with the introduction of porosity. It is interesting to note that, after poling of the material along the freezing direction, the porous BCZT ceramic exhibited a longitudinal piezoelectric constant (d 33) that was higher than that of the dense BCZT; this has been recently observed for other porous BCZT ceramics. As a result of the high d 33 , the porous BCZT exhibited a high calculated electromechanical coupling coefficient at its thickness-mode (k t 2). The cross section of the nanocellulose aerogel was examined by SEM, see (e), indicating a distance of \u223c100 \u03bcm between adjacent pore walls of the aerogel, and the CT image in (f) provides a 3D visualization of the nanocellulose aerogel, which exhibits a 2\u20132 porous lamella structure. The microstructure of the pore wall was further characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM), see (d). The hydrophobic and oleophilic properties were examined, and (h) shows that the aerogel exhibited excellent hydrophobic properties due to a high contact angle of 142\xb0, which was maintained on the material surface for over 120 s. In contrast, the aerogels displayed desirable oleophilic properties as shown in (i), in which an oil droplet applied to the material surface was gradually absorbed in 70 s and completely absorbed in 140 s. On applying an AC voltage across the piezoelectric element, it is able to vibrate and resonate in its thickness direction. Interestingly, the lower frequency radial mode (\u223c 0.4 MHz) indicates some damping by the robot housing, and this is likely to be due to clamping of the piezoelectric at its edges as it attempts to achieve radial resonance. As shown in (a), for the dense BCZT ceramics, the modulus of electrical impedance, Z, decreased with increasing frequency. The low frequency resonance peaks for the dense BCZT ceramic that are observed below 1 MHz are due to the radial resonance mode, and its third harmonic. The thickness-mode resonance of the piezoelectric element can be observed at a higher frequency of \u223c 2.28 MHz, where the electric impedance decreased to the minimum value at the resonance frequency and then increased to the maximum at the anti-resonance frequency. Using the same method, the frequency dependence of the electric impedance of the porous BCZT ceramic was measured, as shown in (b). In this case, no peaks associated with the radial resonance was observed below 1 MHz; this was due to the introduction of aligned porosity in the ceramic structure introducing significant damping in the radial direction that is perpendicular to the direction of the aligned porosity. Since the piezoelectric phase in the porous BCZT was aligned in the thickness direction due to the directional freezing, a clear thickness-mode resonance peak could be observed at \u223c 1.47 MHz. The reduction in the resonance frequency, compared to the dense material of the same thickness, is a result of the lower Young\u2019s modulus of the material due to the presence of porosity, see Eq. 1(b) and Eq. (11), which also reduces the acoustic wave velocity in the material. Only small differences were observed in the resonance frequency and the impedance amplitude in both the dense and porous BCZT ceramics, which may be due to the clamping effects of robot housing and water on the piezoelectric element. For example, (a) shows the data for the microrobot based on a porous BCZT ceramic that is subjected to an AC voltage with a voltage amplitude of 25 V at a frequency of 1.47 MHz as a result of the generation of an acoustic propulsion force, the robot moved along the tank with the displacement gradually increasing time. As a result, information on the displacement and speed of the robot at any time point could be extracted, as shown in (b) and (c), respectively; a video of the whole swimming event under 25 V at 1.47 MHz is provided in supplementary information. The distance moved by the swimming microrobots based on dense and porous BCZT ceramics for a range of applied voltage amplitudes are shown in (a) and (b), respectively. For comparison, the distance moved by the robot at the time of 2 s is marked, where the displacement increased with the applied voltage for the robots. In addition, the displacement of the swimming robot based on porous BCZT was larger than that of the dense BCZT. For example, at 2 s, the displacements of the robot based on the dense material at voltage amplitudes of 10, 20, and 30 V were 1.5 cm, 4.1 cm, and 7.4 cm, respectively. While for the porous BCZT for the same applied voltage, the distance moved was 2.7 cm, 9.0 cm, and 14.3 cm, respectively. This indicates that the robot using the porous BCZT ceramic moved faster than the robot based on dense BCZT. During the measurement of the swimming speed, the robot is assumed to be accelerated by a F prop that is generated by the AC voltage source. Simultaneously, the robot is assumed to be affected by the tensile drag due to the electrical wires (F wire) and an additional drag due to water (F water); this is described below, where m is the mass of the robot and x\u0308 is the acceleration of the robot. F water is considered to be a damping force, which is proportional to the speed of the robot (x\u0307) as described by, where r is the equivalent damping force coefficient of water. By substituting into , the displacement, x, of the robot can be determined as a function of time (t) as below. where A 0 is a constant, and \u03b4 is the phase angle between the x and the x\u0307. By substituting the m,x and t into , the remaining parameters can be determined by fitting; these include A 0, c, r, \u03b4 and F prop. The F prop obtained for the robots is shown in (b) as a function of the amplitude of the applied AC voltage, where it can be seen that the F propof the robots increased with the applied voltage. It can be seen in (b) that for the same applied voltage, the robot based on the porous BCZT exhibited a propulsion force, F prop, that was approximately twice as high as that of the robot with the dense BCZT. Therefore, such an improvement in the F prop for the porous BCZT is primarily due to the reduced acoustic impedance and lower piezoelectric element mass. The amplitude of the required driving current (I 0), for a given driving voltage (V 0 ), can be calculated via , where f 0 is the resonance frequency of the piezoelectric element, and C is the capacitance of the piezoelectric element. The power required for a given (V 0 ) is where P ave is a time-average power of the regular charging process of the BCZT ceramics from zero volts to V 0. Since the introduction of porosity reduces both the resonance frequency f 0 ((b) and ) and the device capacitance C (due to the lower permittivity, ), the porous BCZT ceramic required a smaller driving current and power compared to those of the dense counterpart. Specifically, at the driving voltage of 25 V, the driving current amplitude (I 0) and average power (P ave) for the porous ceramic were \u223c200 mA and \u223c4.6 W, while those were \u223c600 mA and 13.4 W for the dense counterpart, see (c). While a direct comparison is difficult since the working conditions (such as dimensions, voltage, frequency etc.) are different, the porous BCZT compares favourably compared to other robots.

# TITLE
Enhanced buoyancy and propulsion in 3D printed swimming micro-robots based on a hydrophobic nano-fibrillated cellulose aerogel and porous lead-free piezoelectric ceramics

# ABSTRACT
Detailed characterisation and modelling of the swimming robots demonstrated that a swimming robot based on a lead-free porous Ba0.85Ca0.15Zr0.1Ti0.9O3 (BCZT) ceramic exhibited a higher acoustic radiation propulsion force and a faster swimming speed compared to a robot fabricated using a dense ceramic element.

# INTRODUCTION
As an alternative approach, piezoelectric materials are being considered whereby propulsion is achieved by a process of water jetting or the generation of surface acoustic waves (SAWs) and bulk acoustic waves (BAWs). The range of piezoelectric materials examined to date for such applications include ferroelectric materials, such as lead zirconate titanate , lithium niobate , and (Bi, Na, Ba)(Ti, Mn)O3 in bulk or thin film form. One challenge of using piezoelectric ceramics is their high acoustic impedance (Z = \u03c1B, where \u03c1 is the density and B is the bulk modulus), which is much higher than that of water due to the high density and stiffness of the piezoelectric ceramic. The porosity of the lightweight nanofibrillated cellulose aerogel can be as high as 97 %. The overall structure of the robot and the housing based on 3D printing are initially introduced, and processing of the nanocellulose and the resulting hydrophobic and oleophilic properties are then investigated in detail.

# CONCLUSION
The nanocellulose aerogel exhibited excellent hydrophobic properties due to a high contact angle (142\xb0), which was maintained on the material surface for extended periods of time to provide long-term operation. A new analysis model was developed to quantify the benefits of introducing porosity into the active Ba0.85Ca0.15Zr0.1Ti0.9O3 (BCZT) piezoelectric element and inform materials design, namely, to decrease the acoustic impedance of the material and lower the overall mass, while also maintaining the piezoelectric strain and thickness-mode resonance. Detailed characterisation and analysis of the swimming robots that were manufactured by 3D printing demonstrate that a swimming robot based on the porous BCZT exhibited a faster swim speed and a larger acoustic radiation propulsion force compared to a robot fabricated from the dense BCZT element. The use of a porous BCZT element was also shown to reduce the driving current and power requirements as a result of (i) the lower resonant frequency due to the lower stiffness and density of the piezoelectric, and (ii) a lower total device capacitance due to the lower permittivity of the porous material. The ability of the low acoustic impedance porous BCZT to achieve an improved propulsion force via a thickness mode resonance also indicates potential for use as an active piezoelectric element where acoustic impedance matching is highly desirable, such as ultrasonic transducers for medical and non-destructive evaluation applications.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
As shown in -a(i), we consider a piezoelectric swimming microrobot that is driven by an AC voltage source at its thickness-mode resonance, where the robot generates an acoustic radiation force (F ARF) into a water medium, and the piezoelectric element is in direct contact with water. Using the converse piezoelectric effect, the piezoelectric disk vibrates in response to an applied AC in the thickness direction, where the disk is considered to be resonating in thickness-mode. As a result of the vibration of the piezoelectric material, an acoustic radiation pressure is formed at the interface between the piezoelectric material and the water medium, where, where p inter is the acoustic pressure amplitude at the interface, \u03c1 water and c water are the density of water and the acoustic wave speed in water, respectively. The terms \u03c9 and A are the angular speed and amplitude of the vibration, respectively. The acoustic radiation pressure is then transmitted to the surrounding water and the piezoelectric material by oscillating the medium (piezoelectric or water) at a particle velocity (u i). where t is time and x is the position along the vibration direction, with x=0 representing the position of the piezoelectric-water interface. When the acoustic wave is transmitting, the acoustic pressure (p i) in the water (p water) and the piezoelectric material (p piezo) is represented by,  Using the particle speed (u i) and the acoustic pressure (p i), the kinetic energy density (K i) and the potential energy density (U i) of the water and the piezoelectric material due to the acoustic radiation pressure can be obtained:  Therefore, the acoustic radiation pressure P i in the water and the piezoelectric material can be calculated as,  Due to the difference between the acoustic radiation pressure in the water P water and the piezoelectric P piezo, the resulting acoustic radiation force F ARF is given by: where S is the area of the vibrating surface of the piezoelectric material. As the acoustic radiation force F ARF and the acoustic radiation propulsion force (F Prop) are produced simultaneously, then:  Since the F Prop is highly correlated to a variety of properties of the piezoelectric material, including its density, piezoelectric d 33 strain coefficient and elastic modulus, we now examine how the introduction of porosity can used to tailor the magnitude of the F Prop. To achieve a high vibration amplitude (A), the piezoelectric element is typically operated at its resonance frequency (f 0). Since the acoustic pressure amplitude at the interface (p inter) is proportional to the angular speed of the vibration (\u03c9), as shown in , the AC voltage frequency should match the thickness-mode resonance frequency, f 0, of the piezoelectric element. For a piezoelectric disk, f 0 can be expressed as where h is the thickness of the piezoelectric disk, and Y and \u03c1 are the Young\u2019s modulus and density of the piezoelectric material, respectively. As a result, the introduction of porosity can affect the resonant frequency of the piezoelectric material by changing both Y and \u03c1, which thereby affects the acoustic radiation force (F Prop). The influence of porosity volume fraction on ceramic density (\u03c1) has a simple linear correlation, while its impact on the stuffiness (Y) is non-linear. Herein, the model proposed by Boccaccini et al. is used to describe the change in Y with the introduction of randomly distributed pores into the piezoelectric ceramic, as shown in (b) and once the impact of porosity on density and stiffness is known, can be used to determine the influence of porosity volume fraction on resonant frequency, f 0. (b) shows that the introduction of porosity reduces the resonant frequency since it reduces the elastic modulus to a greater extent than the material density. We now consider the impact of porosity on the strain when the piezoelectric disk vibrates at resonance at its thickness mode, where the vibration amplitude (A) can be assumed to be correlated to the longitudinal piezoelectric constant (d 33), which is a measure of the strain per unit electric field, where V is the AC voltage amplitude applied across the piezoelectric element. As shown in (c), the dependence of d 33 on porosity volume is described by a fitting formula based on experimental results from piezoelectric ceramics containing randomly distributed pores in Ref.. It can be seen that the introduction of porosity leads to a non-linear decrease in the d 33 with increasing pore volume fraction since the introduction of pores into the piezoelectric materials reduces the level of polarization. On considering the effect of porosity on d 33, an increase in porosity volume fraction leads to a decrease in the F Prop of the robot, see (c). The acoustic impedance (Z) describes the resistance to the propagation of acoustic waves through the medium, which is defined as the product of the density (\u03c1) and the acoustic velocity (c) of the medium :  For solid materials, such as the piezoelectric ceramics used here, the acoustic velocity (c piezo) can be expressed by the bulk modulus (B) and density (\u03c1) as  For homogeneous materials, B=Y/ 3(1\u22122\u03bd); where \u03bd is the Poisson\u2019s ratio. The introduction of porosity into the active piezoelectric element clearly has an inter-dependent influence on the F Prop generated by the robot; this a decrease in the resonance frequency (f 0), vibration amplitude (A) and acoustic impedance (Z piezo). Among them, a reduction in resonant frequency, f 0, and vibration amplitude, A, due to the introduction of porosity can be considered undesirable in terms of reducing F Prop. On considering the impact of porosity on all three parameters, the overall influence of porosity on F Prop is shown in (e), in which the F Prop can be observed to increase significantly with increasing porosity volume until the porosity volume reaches a relatively high level of \u223c80 vol%; the observed decrease in F Prop at pore fractions above 80 vol% is primarily a result of the very low d 33 coefficients and low amplitude at these high pore volume fractions, see (c). In summary, the modelling has shown that a porous piezoelectric with a porosity level lower than 80 vol% which exhibits a low acoustic impedance can enable a swimming micro-robot to achieve a high F Prop, exceeding that of a robot manufactured using dense piezoelectric materials. This is now experimentally validated in the following discussion and subsequent experimental characterisation. (b) shows scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the cross section of the porous BCZT ceramic, where the freezing direction is indicated. The freeze cast material exhibited a lamellar porous structure, where the pores are clearly aligned in the freezing direction; the porosity volume fraction was 49.5 % and the polarization direction along the direction in freezing. In addition, the computed tomographic (CT) image provides a 3D visualization of the porous BCZT, as shown in (c), where the vertically aligned pores introduced by the directional freezing of water can be observed. The freeze-casting process therefore successfully introduced a 2\u20132 porous structure into the BCZT ceramics. The dense BCZT fabricated by conventional uniaxial cold-pressing and sintering has a low porosity volume fraction of 1.4 %. The measured properties of both the dense and porous BCZT are summarized in , which include the density, porosity fraction, Young\u2019s modulus, relative permittivity at constant stress, and dielectric loss. The elastic modulus of the piezoelectric material, Y, was obtained from the electromechanical coupling coefficient (k t 2) as, where \u03b5 0 is permittivity of free space and \u03b5 33 \u03c3 is the relative permittivity at constant stress. Due to the introduction of porosity, there was a significant reduction in the relative permittivity at constant stress (\u03b5 33 \u03c3) and the Young\u2019s modulus (Y) of the BCZT. No significant change was observed in the dielectric loss (tan \u03b4) with the introduction of porosity. It is interesting to note that, after poling of the material along the freezing direction, the porous BCZT ceramic exhibited a longitudinal piezoelectric constant (d 33) that was higher than that of the dense BCZT; this has been recently observed for other porous BCZT ceramics. As a result of the high d 33 , the porous BCZT exhibited a high calculated electromechanical coupling coefficient at its thickness-mode (k t 2). The cross section of the nanocellulose aerogel was examined by SEM, see (e), indicating a distance of \u223c100 \u03bcm between adjacent pore walls of the aerogel, and the CT image in (f) provides a 3D visualization of the nanocellulose aerogel, which exhibits a 2\u20132 porous lamella structure. The microstructure of the pore wall was further characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM), see (d). The hydrophobic and oleophilic properties were examined, and (h) shows that the aerogel exhibited excellent hydrophobic properties due to a high contact angle of 142\xb0, which was maintained on the material surface for over 120 s. In contrast, the aerogels displayed desirable oleophilic properties as shown in (i), in which an oil droplet applied to the material surface was gradually absorbed in 70 s and completely absorbed in 140 s. On applying an AC voltage across the piezoelectric element, it is able to vibrate and resonate in its thickness direction. Interestingly, the lower frequency radial mode (\u223c 0.4 MHz) indicates some damping by the robot housing, and this is likely to be due to clamping of the piezoelectric at its edges as it attempts to achieve radial resonance. As shown in (a), for the dense BCZT ceramics, the modulus of electrical impedance, Z, decreased with increasing frequency. The low frequency resonance peaks for the dense BCZT ceramic that are observed below 1 MHz are due to the radial resonance mode, and its third harmonic. The thickness-mode resonance of the piezoelectric element can be observed at a higher frequency of \u223c 2.28 MHz, where the electric impedance decreased to the minimum value at the resonance frequency and then increased to the maximum at the anti-resonance frequency. Using the same method, the frequency dependence of the electric impedance of the porous BCZT ceramic was measured, as shown in (b). In this case, no peaks associated with the radial resonance was observed below 1 MHz; this was due to the introduction of aligned porosity in the ceramic structure introducing significant damping in the radial direction that is perpendicular to the direction of the aligned porosity. Since the piezoelectric phase in the porous BCZT was aligned in the thickness direction due to the directional freezing, a clear thickness-mode resonance peak could be observed at \u223c 1.47 MHz. The reduction in the resonance frequency, compared to the dense material of the same thickness, is a result of the lower Young\u2019s modulus of the material due to the presence of porosity, see Eq. 1(b) and Eq. (11), which also reduces the acoustic wave velocity in the material. Only small differences were observed in the resonance frequency and the impedance amplitude in both the dense and porous BCZT ceramics, which may be due to the clamping effects of robot housing and water on the piezoelectric element. For example, (a) shows the data for the microrobot based on a porous BCZT ceramic that is subjected to an AC voltage with a voltage amplitude of 25 V at a frequency of 1.47 MHz as a result of the generation of an acoustic propulsion force, the robot moved along the tank with the displacement gradually increasing time. As a result, information on the displacement and speed of the robot at any time point could be extracted, as shown in (b) and (c), respectively; a video of the whole swimming event under 25 V at 1.47 MHz is provided in supplementary information. The distance moved by the swimming microrobots based on dense and porous BCZT ceramics for a range of applied voltage amplitudes are shown in (a) and (b), respectively. For comparison, the distance moved by the robot at the time of 2 s is marked, where the displacement increased with the applied voltage for the robots. In addition, the displacement of the swimming robot based on porous BCZT was larger than that of the dense BCZT. For example, at 2 s, the displacements of the robot based on the dense material at voltage amplitudes of 10, 20, and 30 V were 1.5 cm, 4.1 cm, and 7.4 cm, respectively. While for the porous BCZT for the same applied voltage, the distance moved was 2.7 cm, 9.0 cm, and 14.3 cm, respectively. This indicates that the robot using the porous BCZT ceramic moved faster than the robot based on dense BCZT. During the measurement of the swimming speed, the robot is assumed to be accelerated by a F prop that is generated by the AC voltage source. Simultaneously, the robot is assumed to be affected by the tensile drag due to the electrical wires (F wire) and an additional drag due to water (F water); this is described below, where m is the mass of the robot and x\u0308 is the acceleration of the robot. F water is considered to be a damping force, which is proportional to the speed of the robot (x\u0307) as described by, where r is the equivalent damping force coefficient of water. By substituting into , the displacement, x, of the robot can be determined as a function of time (t) as below. where A 0 is a constant, and \u03b4 is the phase angle between the x and the x\u0307. By substituting the m,x and t into , the remaining parameters can be determined by fitting; these include A 0, c, r, \u03b4 and F prop. The F prop obtained for the robots is shown in (b) as a function of the amplitude of the applied AC voltage, where it can be seen that the F propof the robots increased with the applied voltage. It can be seen in (b) that for the same applied voltage, the robot based on the porous BCZT exhibited a propulsion force, F prop, that was approximately twice as high as that of the robot with the dense BCZT. Therefore, such an improvement in the F prop for the porous BCZT is primarily due to the reduced acoustic impedance and lower piezoelectric element mass. The amplitude of the required driving current (I 0), for a given driving voltage (V 0 ), can be calculated via , where f 0 is the resonance frequency of the piezoelectric element, and C is the capacitance of the piezoelectric element. The power required for a given (V 0 ) is where P ave is a time-average power of the regular charging process of the BCZT ceramics from zero volts to V 0. Since the introduction of porosity reduces both the resonance frequency f 0 ((b) and ) and the device capacitance C (due to the lower permittivity, ), the porous BCZT ceramic required a smaller driving current and power compared to those of the dense counterpart. Specifically, at the driving voltage of 25 V, the driving current amplitude (I 0) and average power (P ave) for the porous ceramic were \u223c200 mA and \u223c4.6 W, while those were \u223c600 mA and 13.4 W for the dense counterpart, see (c). While a direct comparison is difficult since the working conditions (such as dimensions, voltage, frequency etc.) are different, the porous BCZT compares favourably compared to other robots.
