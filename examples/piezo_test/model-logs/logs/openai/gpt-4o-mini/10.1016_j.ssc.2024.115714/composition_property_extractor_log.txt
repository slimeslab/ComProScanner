# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
For the ACP process, b shows the impact of loading cycles (N) on d33 and longitudinal mode \u03b5E^{T} 33/\u03b50 when the frequency is 0.1 Hz and the poling electric field maintains 14 kV/cm. It can be seen that the loading cycles N of the ACP (0.1 Hz) procedure exert a notable impact on d33 and \u03b5E^{T} 33/\u03b50. With the increase of N, the d33 value rises first and then falls down, and the maximum d33 value appears in 5 loading cycles, reaching 1780 pC/N. The change trend of \u03b5E^{T} 33/\u03b50 value keeps pace with the fluctuation of d33. The d33 and \u03b5E^{T} 33/\u03b50 values for the [001]-oriented PMN-0.26 PT single crystal exhibit a downward trend when N exceeds 5, showing that appropriate loading cycles are in favor of achieving the best poling effect. Furthermore, when the N value exceeds 5, too much crack may be generated due to too much poling time, which will deteriorate electrical performance. compares the d33 and kt difference for the PMN-0.26 PT single crystal during both the DCP and ACP procedure with different external electric fields. The d33 and kt versus electric field curves have similar variation trend for both the DCP and ACP samples, whereas the maximum values of d33 and kt appear at different external electric field. During the DCP procedure, the d33 value reaches maximum value 1250 pC/N at poling electric field 12 kV/cm, and then decreases slightly. During the ACP process, the d33 value increases further and reaches the maximum d33 value 1780 pC/N at poling electric field 14 kV/cm, which shows close to 42.4 % enhancement in contrast to the DCP sample. As shown in b, when the electric field is elevated from 2 kV/cm to 8 kV/cm, the kt value of DCP sample increases from 0.32 to 0.52, whereas the kt value of ACP sample increases from 0.35 to 0.51. However, as the electric field continues to ascend, the kt value of ACP sample reaches the maximum value 0.58 at poling electric field 14 kV/cm, and then exhibits an obviously decline trend till 20 kV/cm, whereas the DCP sample keeps stable kt value at around 0.51. Therefore, the optimum condition for the low frequency (0.1 Hz) ACP procedure is obtained under electric field 14 kV/cm with 5 cycles. According to the phase diagram of pseudo-binary PMN-xPT ferroelectric single crystal, the unpoled PMN-0.26 PT single crystal (NOP) is away from the MPB region and presents rhombohedral (R) phase at room temperature. shows the temperature dependence of \u03b5E^{T} 33/\u03b50 of the PMN-0.26 PT single crystal before poling and after poling. For the following experiment, the ACP conditions are maintained at 0.1 Hz, 14 kV/cm, and 5 loading cycles. After poling, both the DCP and ACP samples undergo a successive three-phase ferroelectric phase transition during heating, i.e., rhombohedral ferroelectric phase-tetragonal ferroelectric phase-cubic paraelectric phase (R-T-C), showing that the applied electric field along the [001] orientation directly induces the tetragonal ferroelectric phase in the PMN-0.26 PT composition below the Curie temperature (TC). Such phenomenon is consistent with the high-resolution synchrotron diffraction result of the PMN-0.26 PT single crystal recently reported by Qiu et al., which verifies that no monoclinic phase exists in PMN-0.26 PT during the ACP process. Comparing with the DCP sample, the ACP sample has a higher dielectric constant 39800 and a sharper dielectric peak at around 99.7 \xb0C, which may be related to the formation of the polar nano regions (PNRs). Given the equation d33 = 2Q11\u03b533Ps , a larger piezoelectric response d33 can be anticipated in the ACP sample due to its larger dielectric constant. However, when the temperature is above TC, there is almost no difference between the DCP and ACP samples since they all present the high-temperature cubic paraelectric phase (C). provides the basic properties of this work and some relaxor-PbTiO3 ferroelectric single crystals. The ACP PMN-0.26 PT single crystal has a higher ferroelectric phase transition temperature 99.7 \xb0C as compared with some other pseudo-ternary relaxor-PbTiO3 ferroelectric single crystals, suggesting that the PMN-0.26 PT single crystal has better thermal stability. shows the P-E and S-E hysteresis loops of the ACP treated [001]-oriented PMN-0.26 PT single crystal at various temperatures measured at 10 Hz and E = 20 kV/cm, in which the electric field provides enough energy to overcome the energy barrier for the complete switching and reversal of domains. With the increase of temperature, the maximum polarization Pm and coercive field Ec decrease gradually, and the \u201csaturated hysteresis loop\u201d changes to a \u201cslim hysteresis loop\u201d suddenly at 150 \xb0C. By contrast with the P-E hysteresis loop, the change of bipolar S-E hysteresis loop with temperature of the ACP PMN-0.26 PT single crystal shows more intricated behavior. As presented in b, the S-E loop becomes broader, has larger strain and hysteresis, and exhibits obvious negative strain between 60 \xb0C and 90 \xb0C, correlating with the temperature induced R-T ferroelectric phase transition. Above 90 \xb0C, the positive strain tends to increase with further elevating temperature, mainly relating to the increased lattice expansion and easier switching of ferroelectric domains. As the temperature increases, the Ec value decreases slowly from 1.97 kV/cm at room temperature to 1.41 kV/cm at 80 \xb0C. Subsequently, an abnormal slight increase occurs at 100 \xb0C and the Ec value increases to 1.55 kV/cm, correlating with the R-T ferroelectric phase transition. Then, the Ec value decreases significantly and almost linearly to 0.56 kV/cm until 130 \xb0C, and becomes nearly stable of 0.54 kV/cm with further increasing temperature to 150 \xb0C. The change of maximum strain Smax is more obvious around the R-T phase transition temperature (TR-T), which increases greatly from 0.37 % at room temperature and varies around 0.46 % near TR-T (60\u201390 \xb0C), and then decreases sharply to 0.31 % at 100 \xb0C. With further increasing temperature, the Smax value varies slightly till 130 \xb0C (slightly higher than TC), and then decreases to 0.23 % at 150 \xb0C. At 27 \xb0C, there is no obvious strain hysteresis and strain presents nearly linear dependency on electric filed since the R phase is the dominant phase around room temperature and no phase transition is induced by electric field within 0\u201315 kV/cm. Among 40\u201390 \xb0C, the phase coexistence of R and T occurs. Taking the 90 \xb0C unipolar S-E curve as an example, it can be clearly divided into three sections. Significant nonlinear increase of strain accompanied by large hysteresis is caused by electric field within 1.85\u20132.40 kV/cm, generating gigantic converse piezoelectric coefficient d33\u2217 of 5635\u20136771 p.m./V, and relating to the R-T ferroelectric phase transition. With further elevating the external electric field, the content of T phase increases gradually, leading to the gradual decrease of d33\u2217 value (varying within 6768-4858 p.m./V between 2.41 and 6.21 kV/cm). Above 7.5 kV/cm, the strain hysteresis almost disappears, and the d33\u2217 value significantly decreases to 2458 p.m./V at 15 kV/cm, showing that the PMN-0.26 PT single crystal changes to the T phase completely. At 110 \xb0C, the ACP PMN-0.26 PT single crystal experiences the T-C phase transition at zero electric field, and the T phase still coexists with the C phase at low electric field. The Smax value severely reduces between 110 \xb0C and 150 \xb0C, which can be attributed to the contribution of PNRs with high symmetry in the cubic paraelectric matrix. At 180 \xb0C, the dominant phase is the C phase at the zero electric field. Above 2.5 kV/cm, rather large strain is induced and the strain presents nearly linear increase with elevating the external electric field. Similar change characteristic around the ferroelectric phase transition is also observed in the 0.75 Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.25PbTiO3 single crystals reported by Cao et al.. Albeit many scholars have studied the aging behavior of ferroelectric single crystals after DCP , similar research on the ACP treated sample is relatively lacking. The domain patterns of the PMN-0.26 PT single crystals poled by both the ACP and DCP methods after aging for 3 months are shown in studied by PFM. The domain configuration of the ACP sample is considerably different from that of the DCP sample in the observed 20 \xd7 20 \u03bcmE^{2} region. In the amplitude diagram shown in a and c, the ACP sample presents a series of periodic stripe-like domain structure with more regular lamellar and narrower width patterns as compared with the DCP sample. In the phase diagram shown in b and d, it can be seen that ferroelectric domains with different angles are induced in the ACP sample, in which the phase difference is very large, and the domain walls are relatively obvious. As comparison, the DCP sample presents a weaker image since the flipping direction of the electric dipoles tends to be consistent after the DCP poling. Such difference in domain configuration can be explained that during the ACP procedure the electric field is repeatedly applied reversal, which leads to the adjacent 71\xb0 domain walls to flip and eventually merge in the (001)-poled PMN-0.26 PT single crystal. The 71\xb0 domain walls are energetically easily align and reorientate under low-frequency AC electric field due to their lower energy barriers compared to other domain orientations. The enlargement of the 71\xb0 domain width reduces the polarization variation of the <111> polarization and flattens the free energy profile, thereby enhancing the piezoelectricity accordingly. As shown in a, there is no evident splitting of the (100) and (200) diffraction peaks for different PMN-0.26 PT single crystal samples (NOP, DCP, ACP), implying that these samples still present the rhombohedral phase. After poling, the relative XRD intensity of the diffraction peak increases greatly for the DCP and ACP samples as compared with that of the NOP sample. b shows expanded plots of the (100) and (200) diffraction peaks, and the corresponding full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the PMN-0.26 PT single crystal under different states. After poling, FWHM of the (100) and (200) diffraction peaks increases apparently, but has difference on poling methods. For the (100) diffraction peak, there is no apparent difference in terms of FWHM, being 0.216\xb0 and 0.217\xb0 for the DCP and ACP samples, respectively. FWHM of the (200) diffraction peak increases significantly and presents great difference under different poling methods, being 0.274\xb0, 0.510\xb0 and 0.428\xb0 for the NOP, DCP and ACP samples, respectively. Such increase of FWHM indicates that the ACP and DCP poling increase the domain size and decrease the homogeneity of domain structure. Compared with DCP, FWHM of (200) after ACP is 16.1 % smaller, indirectly revealing that the domain size is smaller and the domain structure is more homogeneous after ACP. In addition, the 2\u03b8 degree of both (100) and (200) diffraction peaks moves towards higher angles, being the DCP (22.21\xb0, 45.13\xb0) and ACP (22.17\xb0, 45.11\xb0) samples, respectively, compared with the NOP (22.11\xb0, 44.99\xb0) sample. In brief, the change of diffraction peaks reflects the total free energy variation of the PMN-0.26 PT single crystal under different states caused by poling. This difference also indicates that the crystal structure formed in the ACP sample has a lower energy barrier than that of the DCP sample, which is related to the presence of 71\xb0 domain structure. This conclusion is well consistent with the results of PFM characterization.

# TITLE
Improving piezoelectric performance in PMN-0.26 PT single crystal via low frequency AC poling

# ABSTRACT
In this experiment, the alternating current poling (ACP) was applied to the 0.74 Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.26PbTiO3 (PMN-0.26 PT) single crystal to explore the impact of low frequency (0.1 Hz) ACP on electrical performance. When the poling condition is loading 5 cycles at 14 kV/cm, high piezoelectric coefficient d33 of 1780 pC/N and giant dielectric constant of 5881 are obtained for the ACP treatment sample, enhanced 42.4 % and 14.3 % by contrast with the conventional direct current poling (DCP), respectively. The values of coercive field, maximum strain, and converse piezoelectric constant d33∗ vary considerably around the ferroelectric phase transition detected by polarization-electric field, as well as bipolar and unipolar electric field-induced strain hysteresis loops. In addition, the domain configuration of the ACP sample presents a more periodic stripe-like structure with narrower width and relatively more uniformity after three months aging as compared with the DCP sample, showing the importance of domain engineering in enhancing electrical performance of ferroelectric single crystals.

# INTRODUCTION
Comparing with the commercialized PbZr1-xTixO3 (PZT)-based ceramics, lead-based relaxor-ferroelectric single crystals with compositions near the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) region have been studied in depth over the past two decades due to their excellent electrical properties. As for the pseudo-binary (1-x)Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-xPbTiO3 (PMNT) single crystal, extraordinary electrical performance with piezoelectric constant d33 > 2500 pC/N and electromechanical coupling coefficients k33 > 0.9 are obtained when the PT content x is within the range from 0.30 to 0.35. In order to regulate piezoelectric performance, an effective strategy of domain engineering was developed in the relaxor-PbTiO3 ferroelectric single crystals. By applying external electric field, ferroelectric domains reorientated, such as for the [001] poled rhombohedral PMNT single crystals, a \u201c4R\u201d engineered domain configuration was formed along four different directions [111], [\u2212111] , and [\u22121-11], explaining the origin of high piezoelectric response. Domain engineering was generally implemented under direct current poling (DCP). Recently, alternating current poling (ACP) has received widespread attention since it provides an effective engineering approach to considerably enhance property with easy adjustment. Many ACP poling conditions, i.e., electric field, frequency, waveform, loading cycles, poling temperature et al., were studied to optimize performance , among which low frequency ACP process was seldom reported. In addition, the discussion on the mechanism for performance enhancement caused by ACP is still in debate. According to the standpoint of early research, the higher domain density plays an important role in property improvement , however, some scholars obtained the opposite conclusion when applying ACP to relaxor ferroelectric single crystals, among which Qiu et al. confirmed that ACP increased the domain size of 0.72 Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.28PbTiO3 single crystal. Moreover, Song et al. claimed that similar result was obtained in the rhombohedral phase 0.27 Pb(In1/2Nb1/2)-0.42 Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)-0.31PbTiO3 single crystal through the ACP poling. For the 0.70 Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.30PbTiO3 single crystal, Chang et al. reported that the X-ray diffraction measurement revealed that the ACP process may induce new domain structure and phase owing to the different diffraction characteristic under different poling conditions. In this work, the 0.74 Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.26PbTiO3 (PMN-0.26 PT) single crystals with composition away from the MPB region were selected to undertake the low frequency ACP poling research. Herein, high piezoelectric constant d33 of 1780 pC/N was acquired by the ACP treatment under 14 kV/cm with 5 loading cycles, presenting 42.4 % enhancement as compared with the conventional DCP process.

# CONCLUSION
In summary, the piezoelectric and dielectric properties of the PMN-0.26 PT single crystal with the ACP treatment are considerably enhanced 42.4 % and 14.3 %, respectively, as compared with those of the DCP procedure, whereas the kt value has little increasement. Significant electrical performance change occurs near the electric field-induced ferroelectric phase transition, especially for Ec, Smax and d33\u2217. After 3 months aging, the ACP-treated PMN-0.26 PT single crystal still maintains rather uniform and regular layered stripe-like domain structure with narrower width, while the domain walls of the DCP sample appear unclear, and its domain pattern presents random distribution. The enlargement of 71\xb0 domain width in the ACP sample during the periodic AC reversal and repeated poling mainly contributes to the enhancement of piezoelectric and dielectric performance. In brief, the low frequency (0.1 Hz) ACP poling has been proven to be an effective domain engineering method to promote the piezoelectric performance of PMNT single crystals.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
For the ACP process, b shows the impact of loading cycles (N) on d33 and longitudinal mode \u03b5E^{T} 33/\u03b50 when the frequency is 0.1 Hz and the poling electric field maintains 14 kV/cm.

Furthermore, when the N value exceeds 5, too much crack may be generated due to too much poling time, which will deteriorate electrical performance. compares the d33 and kt difference for the PMN-0.26 PT single crystal during both the DCP and ACP procedure with different external electric fields. The d33 and kt versus electric field curves have similar variation trend for both the DCP and ACP samples, whereas the maximum values of d33 and kt appear at different external electric field. During the DCP procedure, the d33 value reaches maximum value 1250 pC/N at poling electric field 12 kV/cm, and then decreases slightly. During the ACP process, the d33 value increases further and reaches the maximum d33 value 1780 pC/N at poling electric field 14 kV/cm, which shows close to 42.4 % enhancement in contrast to the DCP sample. As shown in b, when the electric field is elevated from 2 kV/cm to 8 kV/cm, the kt value of DCP sample increases from 0.32 to 0.52, whereas the kt value of ACP sample increases from 0.35 to 0.51. However, as the electric field continues to ascend, the kt value of ACP sample reaches the maximum value 0.58 at poling electric field 14 kV/cm, and then exhibits an obviously decline trend till 20 kV/cm, whereas the DCP sample keeps stable kt value at around 0.51. Therefore, the optimum condition for the low frequency (0.1 Hz) ACP procedure is obtained under electric field 14 kV/cm with 5 cycles. According to the phase diagram of pseudo-binary PMN-xPT ferroelectric single crystal, the unpoled PMN-0.26 PT single crystal (NOP) is away from the MPB region and presents rhombohedral (R) phase at room temperature. shows the temperature dependence of \u03b5E^{T} 33/\u03b50 of the PMN-0.26 PT single crystal before poling and after poling. For the following experiment, the ACP conditions are maintained at 0.1 Hz, 14 kV/cm, and 5 loading cycles. After poling, both the DCP and ACP samples undergo a successive three-phase ferroelectric phase transition during heating, i.e., rhombohedral ferroelectric phase-tetragonal ferroelectric phase-cubic paraelectric phase (R-T-C), showing that the applied electric field along the [001] orientation directly induces the tetragonal ferroelectric phase in the PMN-0.26 PT composition below the Curie temperature (TC). Such phenomenon is consistent with the high-resolution synchrotron diffraction result of the PMN-0.26 PT single crystal recently reported by Qiu et al., which verifies that no monoclinic phase exists in PMN-0.26 PT during the ACP process. Comparing with the DCP sample, the ACP sample has a higher dielectric constant 39800 and a sharper dielectric peak at around 99.7 \xb0C, which may be related to the formation of the polar nano regions (PNRs). Given the equation d33 = 2Q11\u03b533Ps , a larger piezoelectric response d33 can be anticipated in the ACP sample due to its larger dielectric constant. However, when the temperature is above TC, there is almost no difference between the DCP and ACP samples since they all present the high-temperature cubic paraelectric phase (C). provides the basic properties of this work and some relaxor-PbTiO3 ferroelectric single crystals. The ACP PMN-0.26 PT single crystal has a higher ferroelectric phase transition temperature 99.7 \xb0C as compared with some other pseudo-ternary relaxor-PbTiO3 ferroelectric single crystals, suggesting that the PMN-0.26 PT single crystal has better thermal stability. shows the P-E and S-E hysteresis loops of the ACP treated [001]-oriented PMN-0.26 PT single crystal at various temperatures measured at 10 Hz and E = 20 kV/cm, in which the electric field provides enough energy to overcome the energy barrier for the complete switching and reversal of domains. With the increase of temperature, the maximum polarization Pm and coercive field Ec decrease gradually, and the \u201csaturated hysteresis loop\u201d changes to a \u201cslim hysteresis loop\u201d suddenly at 150 \xb0C. By contrast with the P-E hysteresis loop, the change of bipolar S-E hysteresis loop with temperature of the ACP PMN-0.26 PT single crystal shows more intricated behavior. As presented in b, the S-E loop becomes broader, has larger strain and hysteresis, and exhibits obvious negative strain between 60 \xb0C and 90 \xb0C, correlating with the temperature induced R-T ferroelectric phase transition. Above 90 \xb0C, the positive strain tends to increase with further elevating temperature, mainly relating to the increased lattice expansion and easier switching of ferroelectric domains. As the temperature increases, the Ec value decreases slowly from 1.97 kV/cm at room temperature to 1.41 kV/cm at 80 \xb0C. Subsequently, an abnormal slight increase occurs at 100 \xb0C and the Ec value increases to 1.55 kV/cm, correlating with the R-T ferroelectric phase transition. Then, the Ec value decreases significantly and almost linearly to 0.56 kV/cm until 130 \xb0C, and becomes nearly stable of 0.54 kV/cm with further increasing temperature to 150 \xb0C. The change of maximum strain Smax is more obvious around the R-T phase transition temperature (TR-T), which increases greatly from 0.37 % at room temperature and varies around 0.46 % near TR-T (60\u201390 \xb0C), and then decreases sharply to 0.31 % at 100 \xb0C. With further increasing temperature, the Smax value varies slightly till 130 \xb0C (slightly higher than TC), and then decreases to 0.23 % at 150 \xb0C. At 27 \xb0C, there is no obvious strain hysteresis and strain presents nearly linear dependency on electric filed since the R phase is the dominant phase around room temperature and no phase transition is induced by electric field within 0\u201315 kV/cm. Among 40\u201390 \xb0C, the phase coexistence of R and T occurs. Taking the 90 \xb0C unipolar S-E curve as an example, it can be clearly divided into three sections. Significant nonlinear increase of strain accompanied by large hysteresis is caused by electric field within 1.85\u20132.40 kV/cm, generating gigantic converse piezoelectric coefficient d33\u2217 of 5635\u20136771 p.m./V, and relating to the R-T ferroelectric phase transition. With further elevating the external electric field, the content of T phase increases gradually, leading to the gradual decrease of d33\u2217 value (varying within 6768-4858 p.m./V between 2.41 and 6.21 kV/cm). Above 7.5 kV/cm, the strain hysteresis almost disappears, and the d33\u2217 value significantly decreases to 2458 p.m./V at 15 kV/cm, showing that the PMN-0.26 PT single crystal changes to the T phase completely. At 110 \xb0C, the ACP PMN-0.26 PT single crystal experiences the T-C phase transition at zero electric field, and the T phase still coexists with the C phase at low electric field. The Smax value severely reduces between 110 \xb0C and 150 \xb0C, which can be attributed to the contribution of PNRs with high symmetry in the cubic paraelectric matrix. At 180 \xb0C, the dominant phase is the C phase at the zero electric field. Above 2.5 kV/cm, rather large strain is induced and the strain presents nearly linear increase with elevating the external electric field. Similar change characteristic around the ferroelectric phase transition is also observed in the 0.75 Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.25PbTiO3 single crystals reported by Cao et al.. Albeit many scholars have studied the aging behavior of ferroelectric single crystals after DCP , similar research on the ACP treated sample is relatively lacking. The domain patterns of the PMN-0.26 PT single crystals poled by both the ACP and DCP methods after aging for 3 months are shown in studied by PFM. The domain configuration of the ACP sample is considerably different from that of the DCP sample in the observed 20 \xd7 20 \u03bcmE^{2} region. In the amplitude diagram shown in a and c, the ACP sample presents a series of periodic stripe-like domain structure with more regular lamellar and narrower width patterns as compared with the DCP sample. In the phase diagram shown in b and d, it can be seen that ferroelectric domains with different angles are induced in the ACP sample, in which the phase difference is very large, and the domain walls are relatively obvious. As comparison, the DCP sample presents a weaker image since the flipping direction of the electric dipoles tends to be consistent after the DCP poling. Such difference in domain configuration can be explained that during the ACP procedure the electric field is repeatedly applied reversal, which leads to the adjacent 71\xb0 domain walls to flip and eventually merge in the (001)-poled PMN-0.26 PT single crystal. The 71\xb0 domain walls are energetically easily align and reorientate under low-frequency AC electric field due to their lower energy barriers compared to other domain orientations. The enlargement of the 71\xb0 domain width reduces the polarization variation of the <111> polarization and flattens the free energy profile, thereby enhancing the piezoelectricity accordingly. As shown in a, there is no evident splitting of the (100) and (200) diffraction peaks for different PMN-0.26 PT single crystal samples (NOP, DCP, ACP), implying that these samples still present the rhombohedral phase. After poling, the relative XRD intensity of the diffraction peak increases greatly for the DCP and ACP samples as compared with that of the NOP sample. b shows expanded plots of the (100) and (200) diffraction peaks, and the corresponding full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the PMN-0.26 PT single crystal under different states. After poling, FWHM of the (100) and (200) diffraction peaks increases apparently, but has difference on poling methods. For the (100) diffraction peak, there is no apparent difference in terms of FWHM, being 0.216\xb0 and 0.217\xb0 for the DCP and ACP samples, respectively. FWHM of the (200) diffraction peak increases significantly and presents great difference under different poling methods, being 0.274\xb0, 0.510\xb0 and 0.428\xb0 for the NOP, DCP and ACP samples, respectively. Such increase of FWHM indicates that the ACP and DCP poling increase the domain size and decrease the homogeneity of domain structure. Compared with DCP, FWHM of (200) after ACP is 16.1 % smaller, indirectly revealing that the domain size is smaller and the domain structure is more homogeneous after ACP. In addition, the 2\u03b8 degree of both (100) and (200) diffraction peaks moves towards higher angles, being the DCP (22.21\xb0, 45.13\xb0) and ACP (22.17\xb0, 45.11\xb0) samples, respectively, compared with the NOP (22.11\xb0, 44.99\xb0) sample. In brief, the change of diffraction peaks reflects the total free energy variation of the PMN-0.26 PT single crystal under different states caused by poling. This difference also indicates that the crystal structure formed in the ACP sample has a lower energy barrier than that of the DCP sample, which is related to the presence of 71\xb0 domain structure. This conclusion is well consistent with the results of PFM characterization.

# TITLE
Improving piezoelectric performance in PMN-0.26 PT single crystal via low frequency AC poling

# ABSTRACT
In this experiment, the alternating current poling (ACP) was applied to the 0.74 Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.26PbTiO3 (PMN-0.26 PT) single crystal to explore the impact of low frequency (0.1 Hz) ACP on electrical performance. When the poling condition is loading 5 cycles at 14 kV/cm, high piezoelectric coefficient d33 of 1780 pC/N and giant dielectric constant of 5881 are obtained for the ACP treatment sample, enhanced 42.4 % and 14.3 % by contrast with the conventional direct current poling (DCP), respectively. The values of coercive field, maximum strain, and converse piezoelectric constant d33∗ vary considerably around the ferroelectric phase transition detected by polarization-electric field, as well as bipolar and unipolar electric field-induced strain hysteresis loops. In addition, the domain configuration of the ACP sample presents a more periodic stripe-like structure with narrower width and relatively more uniformity after three months aging as compared with the DCP sample, showing the importance of domain engineering in enhancing electrical performance of ferroelectric single crystals.

# INTRODUCTION
Comparing with the commercialized PbZr1-xTixO3 (PZT)-based ceramics, lead-based relaxor-ferroelectric single crystals with compositions near the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) region have been studied in depth over the past two decades due to their excellent electrical properties. As for the pseudo-binary (1-x)Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-xPbTiO3 (PMNT) single crystal, extraordinary electrical performance with piezoelectric constant d33 > 2500 pC/N and electromechanical coupling coefficients k33 > 0.9 are obtained when the PT content x is within the range from 0.30 to 0.35. In order to regulate piezoelectric performance, an effective strategy of domain engineering was developed in the relaxor-PbTiO3 ferroelectric single crystals. By applying external electric field, ferroelectric domains reorientated, such as for the [001] poled rhombohedral PMNT single crystals, a \u201c4R\u201d engineered domain configuration was formed along four different directions [111], [\u2212111] , and [\u22121-11], explaining the origin of high piezoelectric response. Domain engineering was generally implemented under direct current poling (DCP). Recently, alternating current poling (ACP) has received widespread attention since it provides an effective engineering approach to considerably enhance property with easy adjustment. Many ACP poling conditions, i.e., electric field, frequency, waveform, loading cycles, poling temperature et al., were studied to optimize performance , among which low frequency ACP process was seldom reported. In addition, the discussion on the mechanism for performance enhancement caused by ACP is still in debate. According to the standpoint of early research, the higher domain density plays an important role in property improvement , however, some scholars obtained the opposite conclusion when applying ACP to relaxor ferroelectric single crystals, among which Qiu et al. confirmed that ACP increased the domain size of 0.72 Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.28PbTiO3 single crystal. Moreover, Song et al. claimed that similar result was obtained in the rhombohedral phase 0.27 Pb(In1/2Nb1/2)-0.42 Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)-0.31PbTiO3 single crystal through the ACP poling. For the 0.70 Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.30PbTiO3 single crystal, Chang et al. reported that the X-ray diffraction measurement revealed that the ACP process may induce new domain structure and phase owing to the different diffraction characteristic under different poling conditions. In this work, the 0.74 Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.26PbTiO3 (PMN-0.26 PT) single crystals with composition away from the MPB region were selected to undertake the low frequency ACP poling research. Herein, high piezoelectric constant d33 of 1780 pC/N was acquired by the ACP treatment under 14 kV/cm with 5 loading cycles, presenting 42.4 % enhancement as compared with the conventional DCP process.

# CONCLUSION
In summary, the piezoelectric and dielectric properties of the PMN-0.26 PT single crystal with the ACP treatment are considerably enhanced 42.4 % and 14.3 %, respectively, as compared with those of the DCP procedure, whereas the kt value has little increasement. Significant electrical performance change occurs near the electric field-induced ferroelectric phase transition, especially for Ec, Smax and d33\u2217. After 3 months aging, the ACP-treated PMN-0.26 PT single crystal still maintains rather uniform and regular layered stripe-like domain structure with narrower width, while the domain walls of the DCP sample appear unclear, and its domain pattern presents random distribution. The enlargement of 71\xb0 domain width in the ACP sample during the periodic AC reversal and repeated poling mainly contributes to the enhancement of piezoelectric and dielectric performance. In brief, the low frequency (0.1 Hz) ACP poling has been proven to be an effective domain engineering method to promote the piezoelectric performance of PMNT single crystals.
