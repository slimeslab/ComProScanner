# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A high d 33 is expected for chemically modified KNN ceramics that form the R-T phase boundaries similar to the morphotropic phase boundary observed in classical PZT-based piezoelectric materials. Therefore, we applied feature engineering techniques to statistically analyse the effects of different dopants on the d 33 of KNN-based ceramics. The features in the feature pool were divided into six categories: 1) size factors, such as atomic volume (V), valence electron distance (RDVE) and core electron distance (RDCE); 2) electrochemical factors, such as EN-P, Matyonov-Batsanov electronegativity (EN-MB) and EA; 3) atomic number factors, such as atomic number (AN), Clementi effective nuclear charge (EFF-C) and Slater effective nuclear charge (EFF-S); 4) bond parameter factors, such as polarisability (P) and the ratio of valence electron number to nominal charge (Vec/Z); 5) unique factors, such as tolerance factor (t) and octahedral factor (u) and 6) additional factors, such as the K/Na ratio and influence of doping element on the R-O phase transition temperature (T R_O ). Those features meet the rational criteria of material features , which are 1) representative to the material, 2) sensitive to the target property and 3) easy to obtain. In total, 31 features were prepared for selection. shows the Pearson correlation heatmap, which illustrates the correlation matrix of the features. Features with r > 0.95 were considered redundant in the ML models. For example, t was retained while R, AO, CVW, RCOV and EVW were excluded. Thus, the number of features was reduced to 20. We analysed the contribution of each remaining feature to predict d 33 using the gradient-boosted method. shows the top 10 features ranked by their importance in describing d 33. Features with lower importance scores contributed less to the prediction of d 33 than features with higher scores. The phase transition temperature features were identified as important from the ML perspective. This result can be explained by the fact that the K/Na ratio can not generally reflect the impact of dopants on d 33. Different K/Na can implicate the same high d 33  in the view of the ML model, making it difficult for the model to learn the d 33 pattern based on the undetermined stoichiometry of dopants. As a result, the K/Na has not been marked with high importance from the aspect of the ML algorithm. At this stage, we developed precise predictive ML models for predicting d 33 based on selected features. The most appropriate ML model type was first selected. As shown in a, the SVR_r model achieved the lowest RMSE when the number of features exceeded three. The comparison between SVR_l, SVR_p and SVR_r highlighted the advantage of the radial basis function kernel in handling nonlinearly separable data, thereby outperforming both the polynomial and linear function kernels. Although the RR and SVR_l models performed similarly owing to their linear nature, the RFR model, despite performing well with less than three features, did not match the performance of the SVR_r model with high-dimensional input data. Overall, the SVR_r model demonstrated robust performance for up to eight features, making it the preferred choice for this study owing to its superior performance compared to other ML algorithms. This result confirmed the advantage of SVR_r in predicting the d 33 values of piezoceramics. To evaluate the SVR_r model for previously unobserved data, we extracted 20 % of the data from the database as a test set. b illustrates the variation in the performance of the SVR_r model validated by a 10-fold CV with an increasing number of input features. For both the training/validation and test sets, a noticeable decrease in RMSE and an increase in R E^{ } for up to five features were observed. This tendency demonstrated the ML process from underfitting to overfitting. Based on Occam's razor principle, we selected the feature tuples \u2018W, D, EN-P, EA, T c \u2019 for further validation of the SVR_r model. The selected EN-P and D features are closely related to the features identified as important and general to ferroelectric materials. The EN-P and previously identified Matyonov-Batsanov electronegativity both reflect electronegativity. However, the features eventually used for ML modelling can vary according to specific material systems and target properties. In this case study, the EN-P, D united with W, EA and T c were selected to describe the d 33 value of multidoped KNN-based piezoceramics based on the model evaluation result. The hyperparameter optimisation process of the SVR_r model with the five-tuple features is shown in c. In the SVR_r model, the hyperparameter C acted as a regularisation parameter that controlled the degree of penalty for estimation errors. The hyperparameter \u03b3 determines the extent to which a single training point influences the decision boundary. A larger \u03b3 causes the decision boundary to be more easily affected by points close to it, potentially resulting in a more complex decision boundary that may also overfit the training data. During the grid search process, C was varied from 0 to 10 in increments of 0.2, whereas \u03b3 was varied from 0.1 to 5 in increments of 0.1. The results indicate that the SVR_r model with \u03b3 < 2 and C < 4 exhibited relatively good performance based on the KNN database. In conclusion, excessive feature numbers and hyperparameters that overly complicate the model can lead to overfitting, which decreases model performance. d illustrates the regression and generalisation performance of the SVR_r model with the five-tuple features. In this study, most predicted d 33 values approximately matched the measured values in both the training and test sets. Notably, the ML models tended to \u2018overestimate\u2019 the points when their d 33 was <300 pC/N and \u2018underestimate\u2019 the points when their d 33 was >300 pC/N. A similar phenomenon was reported in a study on BT-based piezoceramics. For points with d 33 values < 300 pC/N, the deviation was likely owing to the high sensitivity of the KNN-based ceramics to sintering conditions. Slight variation in the optimal sintering temperature and duration can lead to significant decrease in d 33. Conversely, for points with d 33 > 300 pC/N, the compositions may be near the polymorphic phase boundary (PPB) in KNN-based ceramics. Compositions near the PPB often exhibit significant d 33 improvements, making them appear as \u2018singular points\u2019 in the dataset. Consequently, the ML model suppressed the predicted d 33 for compositions near PPB and increased the predicted d 33 for compositions far from PPB to balance the prediction accuracy. We believe that identifying the specific features that characterise the PPB in KNN-based ceramics can potentially enhance the model performance. lists the LOOCV errors of the SVR_r model with the five input features. The CV error scale in this study was consistent with those observed in other lead-free systems. The lower errors obtained in this study can be attributed to the process of data standardisation during the ML modelling. When the observed data size is significantly smaller than the material design space, the pure exploitation ET function may easily get stuck in local optima because it does not account for model uncertainty during the search process. The EI function is a valuable tool for identifying global optima because it balances \u03bc and \u03c3. To obtain \u03bc and \u03c3, we trained 500 ML models on 500 datasets generated via the bootstrapping resampling method in this study. Because prediction variance was a key factor in using the EI in this study, the size of the bootstrapped dataset was kept relatively small, identical to the size of the original dataset. After bootstrapping, we trained and deployed ML models across the entire search space to obtain predicted distributions. We added an approximate \u2018bell curve\u2019 of the Gaussian distribution to represent the predicted d 33 distribution of the candidate compositions suggested by the ET and EI functions. The graph shows that the pure ET function identified compounds that were expected to perform well, with high predicted d 33 values located in a narrow range. In contrast, the EI function favoured exploring compositions with relatively higher uncertainties, resulting in predicted d 33 values spanning a broader range than those selected by the ET function. Finally, we conducted three iterations of the active learning loop to validate the proposed methods. d presents the model performance metrics RMSE and R E^{ } for the three experimental iterations. Although the ML performance remained stable on the training sets, it fluctuated on the test sets as the number of iterations increased. The \u2018singular points\u2019 that were randomly distributed between the training and test sets significantly influenced the performance metrics of the ML model. Increasing the number of iterations to expand the database can facilitate obtaining more stable performance metrics. presents the predicted and measured d 33 values for the selected compositions for each iteration. The predicted d 33 comprises the integer components of \u03bc and \u03c3 from 500 predictions generated by the ML models. For all six samples, the disparities between the predicted and measured d 33 values were not significant, demonstrating the excellent predictive capability of the ML models. The largest error of 22 % was observed for Comp4, which was suggested by the EI function in the second iteration. The inconsistencies between the predicted and measured d 33 values may be due to the small database size, which affects the predictions, or variations in sample quality that affect the measured values. Comparisons between the ET and EI functions revealed that the ET function outperformed the exploitation-exploration trade-off EI function in identifying KNN compositions with enhanced d 33, at least for the first three iterations. This result is consistent with a previous study on BT-based ceramics that also focused on the same target property d 33. However, the EI function may outperform ET in other cases, such as when searching for BT-based ceramics with enhanced electrostrains. Two factors likely explain the better performance of ET in this case study: 1) the EI function favoured exploration over exploitation, and the risks associated with exploration did not initially result in exceptional piezoelectricity in the KNN system, and 2) KNN-based ceramics are highly sensitive to compositional variations. A possible approach to emphasise or suppress the effect of exploration is to introduce a parameter \u03be into the EI formula to balance exploitation and exploration. Nevertheless, we believe that the EI function is necessary for optimising the d 33 value of KNN ceramics because it reduces uncertainties in ML models by searching for compositions with high predicted variance. In this study, all synthesised KNN-based ceramics exhibited relatively dense microstructures with an average grain size of 1\u20135 \u03bcm ( ). The SEM analysis indicated no significant differences in microstructures between the ceramics designed by ET and EI functions, suggesting the exclusion of the effects of the preparation methods on the different ceramics. shows the P-E hysteresis loops (a), the bipolar S-E curves (b) and the unipolar S-E curves (c), measured at a frequency of 10 Hz and room temperature for the KNN ceramics. The three compositions selected by ET demonstrated strong ferroelectricity, with P r values exceeding 20 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}. As shown in c (solid lines), the three compositions selected by ET exhibited a large electric field-induced strain exceeding 0.14 % at 30 kV/cm, corresponding to the high-field piezoelectric strain coefficient (d 33\u2217) of >476 p.m./V. The highest d 33\u2217 value of 537 pm/V was obtained for the KNN ceramics selected by ET. By contrast, as indicated by the dashed line in c, the KNN ceramics selected by EI exhibited relatively smaller strains and lower d 33\u2217. Apparently, this trend in the high-field piezoelectric properties for the compositions chosen by the ET and EI functions was similar to that of the d 33 values shown in , reinforcing the accuracy of the ML prediction for the d 33. In addition, b shows that the Comp5_ET_3E^{rd} displayed asymmetric bipolar S-E curves, indicating the presence of defect dipoles. Interestingly, KNN-based ceramics with enhanced piezoelectric properties were successfully identified using the methods outlined in this study. The SVR_r model and pure exploitation strategy led to the discovery of compositions with a d 33 of >300 pC/N, exceeding that of most compositions in the original dataset. From an active learning perspective, a database compiled from published literature may contain noise that prevents the ML models from making accurate predictions across the entire search space. From the perspective of KNN-based ceramics, a well-designed chemical formula is crucial for achieving high-performance KNN piezoceramics. Variations in ceramic processing can cause deviations in the expected d 33 values for KNN compositions. The performance evaluation demonstrated that the ML models effectively captured the underlying data trends. The results demonstrate that combining ML models with efficient search strategies is valuable in identifying high-performing compositions. We believe that by iterating the process and expanding the database, the design and discovery of KNN-based ceramics can be further accelerated using a balanced exploitation-exploration strategy.

# ABSTRACT
In this study, we introduce a data-driven framework to accelerate the design and discovery of lead-free (K,Na)NbO3 (KNN) materials with enhanced piezoelectric performance. Using feature engineering techniques, we demonstrated that the piezoelectric coefficient d
                     33 of KNN materials can be predicted based on a set of elemental and atomic properties. We evaluated six machine learning models and found that support vector regression with a radial basis function kernel achieved high accuracy in predicting the d
                     33 values of KNN ceramics. After three iterations of experimentation and optimisation, we identified an optimal composition with a relatively high d
                     33 of ∼353 pC/N from thousands of possible compositions using a pure exploitation strategy. This study demonstrates an efficient and systematic approach to the composition design of KNN-based piezoceramics, which can be applied to investigate the diverse functional properties of other materials.

# INTRODUCTION
In recent decades, growing concerns about environmental impact and human health have driven considerable efforts to develop lead-free materials to replace widely used Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PZT)-based ceramics. Among them, the lead-free potassium\u2013sodium niobate (K,Na)NbO3 (KNN) solid solutions have emerged as highly promising alternatives to PZT-based materials owing to their high Curie temperature and considerable piezoelectric response. However, the piezoelectric coefficient d 33 of undoped KNN is \u223c80 pC/N , which is not comparable to that of PZT-based materials. Chemical modification effectively enhances the piezoelectric properties of KNN-based materials. Most high-performance KNN ceramics (d 33 > 350 pC/N) reported over the past decade have been chemically modified by multiple dopants. Thus, the range of possible compositions in the search space expanded exponentially with the addition of various dopants to the KNN matrix. In addition, the relations among the compositions, processing parameters and piezoelectric coefficients of KNN systems are highly complex. The limited number of experimental observations across this vast search space, combined with the intricate interplay of intrinsic and extrinsic factors affecting material properties, poses significant challenges when designing high-performance KNN-based materials. Machine learning (ML) techniques have gained popularity in the field of materials science in recent years. ML is a data-driven approach based on data collected from experimental or computational studies that enables the establishment of relations among material composition, structure and properties using existing material data. ML models can use the established relations to predict the properties of unexplored materials. Furthermore, ML can be combined with optimisation methods to accelerate the experimental discovery of new materials. Various materials with tailored properties have been identified using the ML-based approach, such as alloys , polymers , glass , ceramics , etc. Although major progress has been made in predicting d 33 of piezoceramics , it remains challenging to experimentally discover high-performance compositions based on the predictions derived from ML models due to limited empirical investigation. This challenge is more obvious in the KNN-based ceramics compared to the classical barium titanate (BT)-based ceramics. In addition, it has been shown in previous studies  that different material systems rely on different features and models to reach accurate d 33 predictions. The important features, appropriate model configurations and experimental strategies are of great interest to be comprehensively identified for the multidoped KNN systems, which are promising for high d 33 values. Thus, this study aims to extend the application of the ML approach to the experimental exploration of multidoped KNN materials. The interpretable ML and experimental validation results are expected to provide deeper insights into the data-driven discovery of high-performance KNN piezoceramics. Our methods represent a confluence of ML and global optimisation for the experimental design of piezoceramics, emphasising the role of decision-making strategies. As shown in , the specific framework integrates feature engineering, ML, surrogate-based optimisation and experimental observations in a cyclic loop. Using feature engineering techniques, we extracted representative features such as the relative molecular mass (W), ionic displacement (D), electronegativity (EN-P), electron affinity (EA) and Curie temperature (T c) to statistically describe the d 33 values of the samples in our database. In addition, the influence of feature numbers and model hyperparameters on d 33 prediction was analysed. Using the extracted features as inputs, the deployed ML models demonstrated strong predictive ability for estimating d 33, with a coefficient of determination R E^{ } of 0.87 for the training set and 0.83 for the test set. The surrogate-based optimisation strategies for experimental observation leveraged the predictions and uncertainties predicted by the ML models. The reliability of the ML models and effectiveness of the experimental design strategies were validated through three experimental iterations. Notably, through this iterative experimental process, we synthesised an unidentified composition from the entire search space with a d 33 value of approximately 353 pC/N. Our empirical results validated the potential of ML and optimisation methods in identifying high-performance KNN compositions. In summary, the contributions of this study are as follows: 1) We propose a data-driven framework for designing multidoped KNN ceramics, identifying suitable ML algorithm and influential features for predicting d 33 values. 2) We propose and compare two experimental design strategies: pure exploitation and exploitation-exploration balanced strategies, which are supported by results from the three experimental iterations. 3) Unidentified KNN compositions with d 33 > 300 pC/N were identified from approximately 331,000 possibilities whose d 33 values were higher than most compositions in the database.

# CONCLUSION
In this study, we developed a data-driven framework to accelerate the design and discovery of KNN-based ceramics with enhanced piezoelectric properties. We investigated the key factors that affected the d 33 of KNN piezoceramics, which may contribute to a better understanding of the composition-property relationship in the KNN system. We conducted comprehensive ML modelling to establish a predictive model for the piezoelectricity of KNN-based materials. The validated SVR_r model demonstrated good accuracy and generalisability. We further demonstrated the integration of global optimisation methods to efficiently guide experiments based on ML predictions. Finally, our experimentally synthesised samples with d 33 values > 300 pC/N confirmed the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed methods. Our findings demonstrate that ML methods not only enable accurate predictions of material properties but also expedite the discovery of novel functional materials with tailored properties.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A high d 33 is expected for chemically modified KNN ceramics that form the R-T phase boundaries similar to the morphotropic phase boundary observed in classical PZT-based piezoelectric materials. Therefore, we applied feature engineering techniques to statistically analyse the effects of different dopants on the d 33 of KNN-based ceramics. The features in the feature pool were divided into six categories: 1) size factors, such as atomic volume (V), valence electron distance (RDVE) and core electron distance (RDCE); 2) electrochemical factors, such as EN-P, Matyonov-Batsanov electronegativity (EN-MB) and EA; 3) atomic number factors, such as atomic number (AN), Clementi effective nuclear charge (EFF-C) and Slater effective nuclear charge (EFF-S); 4) bond parameter factors, such as polarisability (P) and the ratio of valence electron number to nominal charge (Vec/Z); 5) unique factors, such as tolerance factor (t) and octahedral factor (u) and 6) additional factors, such as the K/Na ratio and influence of doping element on the R-O phase transition temperature (T R_O ). Those features meet the rational criteria of material features , which are 1) representative to the material, 2) sensitive to the target property and 3) easy to obtain. In total, 31 features were prepared for selection. shows the Pearson correlation heatmap, which illustrates the correlation matrix of the features. Features with r > 0.95 were considered redundant in the ML models. For example, t was retained while R, AO, CVW, RCOV and EVW were excluded. Thus, the number of features was reduced to 20. We analysed the contribution of each remaining feature to predict d 33 using the gradient-boosted method. shows the top 10 features ranked by their importance in describing d 33. Features with lower importance scores contributed less to the prediction of d 33 than features with higher scores. The phase transition temperature features were identified as important from the ML perspective. This result can be explained by the fact that the K/Na ratio can not generally reflect the impact of dopants on d 33. Different K/Na can implicate the same high d 33  in the view of the ML model, making it difficult for the model to learn the d 33 pattern based on the undetermined stoichiometry of dopants. As a result, the K/Na has not been marked with high importance from the aspect of the ML algorithm. At this stage, we developed precise predictive ML models for predicting d 33 based on selected features. The most appropriate ML model type was first selected. As shown in a, the SVR_r model achieved the lowest RMSE when the number of features exceeded three. The comparison between SVR_l, SVR_p and SVR_r highlighted the advantage of the radial basis function kernel in handling nonlinearly separable data, thereby outperforming both the polynomial and linear function kernels. Although the RR and SVR_l models performed similarly owing to their linear nature, the RFR model, despite performing well with less than three features, did not match the performance of the SVR_r model with high-dimensional input data. Overall, the SVR_r model demonstrated robust performance for up to eight features, making it the preferred choice for this study owing to its superior performance compared to other ML algorithms. This result confirmed the advantage of SVR_r in predicting the d 33 values of piezoceramics. To evaluate the SVR_r model for previously unobserved data, we extracted 20 % of the data from the database as a test set. b illustrates the variation in the performance of the SVR_r model validated by a 10-fold CV with an increasing number of input features. For both the training/validation and test sets, a noticeable decrease in RMSE and an increase in R E^{ } for up to five features were observed. This tendency demonstrated the ML process from underfitting to overfitting. Based on Occam's razor principle, we selected the feature tuples \u2018W, D, EN-P, EA, T c \u2019 for further validation of the SVR_r model. The selected EN-P and D features are closely related to the features identified as important and general to ferroelectric materials. The EN-P and previously identified Matyonov-Batsanov electronegativity both reflect electronegativity. However, the features eventually used for ML modelling can vary according to specific material systems and target properties. In this case study, the EN-P, D united with W, EA and T c were selected to describe the d 33 value of multidoped KNN-based piezoceramics based on the model evaluation result. The hyperparameter optimisation process of the SVR_r model with the five-tuple features is shown in c. In the SVR_r model, the hyperparameter C acted as a regularisation parameter that controlled the degree of penalty for estimation errors. The hyperparameter \u03b3 determines the extent to which a single training point influences the decision boundary. A larger \u03b3 causes the decision boundary to be more easily affected by points close to it, potentially resulting in a more complex decision boundary that may also overfit the training data. During the grid search process, C was varied from 0 to 10 in increments of 0.2, whereas \u03b3 was varied from 0.1 to 5 in increments of 0.1. The results indicate that the SVR_r model with \u03b3 < 2 and C < 4 exhibited relatively good performance based on the KNN database. In conclusion, excessive feature numbers and hyperparameters that overly complicate the model can lead to overfitting, which decreases model performance. d illustrates the regression and generalisation performance of the SVR_r model with the five-tuple features. In this study, most predicted d 33 values approximately matched the measured values in both the training and test sets. Notably, the ML models tended to \u2018overestimate\u2019 the points when their d 33 was <300 pC/N and \u2018underestimate\u2019 the points when their d 33 was >300 pC/N. A similar phenomenon was reported in a study on BT-based piezoceramics. For points with d 33 values < 300 pC/N, the deviation was likely owing to the high sensitivity of the KNN-based ceramics to sintering conditions. Slight variation in the optimal sintering temperature and duration can lead to significant decrease in d 33. Conversely, for points with d 33 > 300 pC/N, the compositions may be near the polymorphic phase boundary (PPB) in KNN-based ceramics. Compositions near the PPB often exhibit significant d 33 improvements, making them appear as \u2018singular points\u2019 in the dataset. Consequently, the ML model suppressed the predicted d 33 for compositions near PPB and increased the predicted d 33 for compositions far from PPB to balance the prediction accuracy. We believe that identifying the specific features that characterise the PPB in KNN-based ceramics can potentially enhance the model performance. lists the LOOCV errors of the SVR_r model with the five input features. The CV error scale in this study was consistent with those observed in other lead-free systems. The lower errors obtained in this study can be attributed to the process of data standardisation during the ML modelling. When the observed data size is significantly smaller than the material design space, the pure exploitation ET function may easily get stuck in local optima because it does not account for model uncertainty during the search process. The EI function is a valuable tool for identifying global optima because it balances \u03bc and \u03c3. To obtain \u03bc and \u03c3, we trained 500 ML models on 500 datasets generated via the bootstrapping resampling method in this study. Because prediction variance was a key factor in using the EI in this study, the size of the bootstrapped dataset was kept relatively small, identical to the size of the original dataset. After bootstrapping, we trained and deployed ML models across the entire search space to obtain predicted distributions. We added an approximate \u2018bell curve\u2019 of the Gaussian distribution to represent the predicted d 33 distribution of the candidate compositions suggested by the ET and EI functions. The graph shows that the pure ET function identified compounds that were expected to perform well, with high predicted d 33 values located in a narrow range. In contrast, the EI function favoured exploring compositions with relatively higher uncertainties, resulting in predicted d 33 values spanning a broader range than those selected by the ET function. Finally, we conducted three iterations of the active learning loop to validate the proposed methods. d presents the model performance metrics RMSE and R E^{ } for the three experimental iterations. Although the ML performance remained stable on the training sets, it fluctuated on the test sets as the number of iterations increased. The \u2018singular points\u2019 that were randomly distributed between the training and test sets significantly influenced the performance metrics of the ML model. Increasing the number of iterations to expand the database can facilitate obtaining more stable performance metrics. presents the predicted and measured d 33 values for the selected compositions for each iteration. The predicted d 33 comprises the integer components of \u03bc and \u03c3 from 500 predictions generated by the ML models. For all six samples, the disparities between the predicted and measured d 33 values were not significant, demonstrating the excellent predictive capability of the ML models. The largest error of 22 % was observed for Comp4, which was suggested by the EI function in the second iteration. The inconsistencies between the predicted and measured d 33 values may be due to the small database size, which affects the predictions, or variations in sample quality that affect the measured values. Comparisons between the ET and EI functions revealed that the ET function outperformed the exploitation-exploration trade-off EI function in identifying KNN compositions with enhanced d 33, at least for the first three iterations. This result is consistent with a previous study on BT-based ceramics that also focused on the same target property d 33. However, the EI function may outperform ET in other cases, such as when searching for BT-based ceramics with enhanced electrostrains. Two factors likely explain the better performance of ET in this case study: 1) the EI function favoured exploration over exploitation, and the risks associated with exploration did not initially result in exceptional piezoelectricity in the KNN system, and 2) KNN-based ceramics are highly sensitive to compositional variations. A possible approach to emphasise or suppress the effect of exploration is to introduce a parameter \u03be into the EI formula to balance exploitation and exploration. Nevertheless, we believe that the EI function is necessary for optimising the d 33 value of KNN ceramics because it reduces uncertainties in ML models by searching for compositions with high predicted variance. In this study, all synthesised KNN-based ceramics exhibited relatively dense microstructures with an average grain size of 1\u20135 \u03bcm ( ). The SEM analysis indicated no significant differences in microstructures between the ceramics designed by ET and EI functions, suggesting the exclusion of the effects of the preparation methods on the different ceramics. shows the P-E hysteresis loops (a), the bipolar S-E curves (b) and the unipolar S-E curves (c), measured at a frequency of 10 Hz and room temperature for the KNN ceramics. The three compositions selected by ET demonstrated strong ferroelectricity, with P r values exceeding 20 \u03bcC/cmE^{2}. As shown in c (solid lines), the three compositions selected by ET exhibited a large electric field-induced strain exceeding 0.14 % at 30 kV/cm, corresponding to the high-field piezoelectric strain coefficient (d 33\u2217) of >476 p.m./V. The highest d 33\u2217 value of 537 pm/V was obtained for the KNN ceramics selected by ET. By contrast, as indicated by the dashed line in c, the KNN ceramics selected by EI exhibited relatively smaller strains and lower d 33\u2217. Apparently, this trend in the high-field piezoelectric properties for the compositions chosen by the ET and EI functions was similar to that of the d 33 values shown in , reinforcing the accuracy of the ML prediction for the d 33. In addition, b shows that the Comp5_ET_3E^{rd} displayed asymmetric bipolar S-E curves, indicating the presence of defect dipoles. Interestingly, KNN-based ceramics with enhanced piezoelectric properties were successfully identified using the methods outlined in this study. The SVR_r model and pure exploitation strategy led to the discovery of compositions with a d 33 of >300 pC/N, exceeding that of most compositions in the original dataset. From an active learning perspective, a database compiled from published literature may contain noise that prevents the ML models from making accurate predictions across the entire search space. From the perspective of KNN-based ceramics, a well-designed chemical formula is crucial for achieving high-performance KNN piezoceramics. Variations in ceramic processing can cause deviations in the expected d 33 values for KNN compositions. The performance evaluation demonstrated that the ML models effectively captured the underlying data trends. The results demonstrate that combining ML models with efficient search strategies is valuable in identifying high-performing compositions. We believe that by iterating the process and expanding the database, the design and discovery of KNN-based ceramics can be further accelerated using a balanced exploitation-exploration strategy.

# ABSTRACT
In this study, we introduce a data-driven framework to accelerate the design and discovery of lead-free (K,Na)NbO3 (KNN) materials with enhanced piezoelectric performance. Using feature engineering techniques, we demonstrated that the piezoelectric coefficient d
                     33 of KNN materials can be predicted based on a set of elemental and atomic properties. We evaluated six machine learning models and found that support vector regression with a radial basis function kernel achieved high accuracy in predicting the d
                     33 values of KNN ceramics. After three iterations of experimentation and optimisation, we identified an optimal composition with a relatively high d
                     33 of ∼353 pC/N from thousands of possible compositions using a pure exploitation strategy. This study demonstrates an efficient and systematic approach to the composition design of KNN-based piezoceramics, which can be applied to investigate the diverse functional properties of other materials.

# INTRODUCTION
In recent decades, growing concerns about environmental impact and human health have driven considerable efforts to develop lead-free materials to replace widely used Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PZT)-based ceramics. Among them, the lead-free potassium\u2013sodium niobate (K,Na)NbO3 (KNN) solid solutions have emerged as highly promising alternatives to PZT-based materials owing to their high Curie temperature and considerable piezoelectric response. However, the piezoelectric coefficient d 33 of undoped KNN is \u223c80 pC/N , which is not comparable to that of PZT-based materials. Chemical modification effectively enhances the piezoelectric properties of KNN-based materials. Most high-performance KNN ceramics (d 33 > 350 pC/N) reported over the past decade have been chemically modified by multiple dopants. Thus, the range of possible compositions in the search space expanded exponentially with the addition of various dopants to the KNN matrix. In addition, the relations among the compositions, processing parameters and piezoelectric coefficients of KNN systems are highly complex. The limited number of experimental observations across this vast search space, combined with the intricate interplay of intrinsic and extrinsic factors affecting material properties, poses significant challenges when designing high-performance KNN-based materials. Machine learning (ML) techniques have gained popularity in the field of materials science in recent years. ML is a data-driven approach based on data collected from experimental or computational studies that enables the establishment of relations among material composition, structure and properties using existing material data. ML models can use the established relations to predict the properties of unexplored materials. Furthermore, ML can be combined with optimisation methods to accelerate the experimental discovery of new materials. Various materials with tailored properties have been identified using the ML-based approach, such as alloys , polymers , glass , ceramics , etc. Although major progress has been made in predicting d 33 of piezoceramics , it remains challenging to experimentally discover high-performance compositions based on the predictions derived from ML models due to limited empirical investigation. This challenge is more obvious in the KNN-based ceramics compared to the classical barium titanate (BT)-based ceramics. In addition, it has been shown in previous studies  that different material systems rely on different features and models to reach accurate d 33 predictions. The important features, appropriate model configurations and experimental strategies are of great interest to be comprehensively identified for the multidoped KNN systems, which are promising for high d 33 values. Thus, this study aims to extend the application of the ML approach to the experimental exploration of multidoped KNN materials. The interpretable ML and experimental validation results are expected to provide deeper insights into the data-driven discovery of high-performance KNN piezoceramics. Our methods represent a confluence of ML and global optimisation for the experimental design of piezoceramics, emphasising the role of decision-making strategies. As shown in , the specific framework integrates feature engineering, ML, surrogate-based optimisation and experimental observations in a cyclic loop. Using feature engineering techniques, we extracted representative features such as the relative molecular mass (W), ionic displacement (D), electronegativity (EN-P), electron affinity (EA) and Curie temperature (T c) to statistically describe the d 33 values of the samples in our database. In addition, the influence of feature numbers and model hyperparameters on d 33 prediction was analysed. Using the extracted features as inputs, the deployed ML models demonstrated strong predictive ability for estimating d 33, with a coefficient of determination R E^{ } of 0.87 for the training set and 0.83 for the test set. The surrogate-based optimisation strategies for experimental observation leveraged the predictions and uncertainties predicted by the ML models. The reliability of the ML models and effectiveness of the experimental design strategies were validated through three experimental iterations. Notably, through this iterative experimental process, we synthesised an unidentified composition from the entire search space with a d 33 value of approximately 353 pC/N. Our empirical results validated the potential of ML and optimisation methods in identifying high-performance KNN compositions. In summary, the contributions of this study are as follows: 1) We propose a data-driven framework for designing multidoped KNN ceramics, identifying suitable ML algorithm and influential features for predicting d 33 values. 2) We propose and compare two experimental design strategies: pure exploitation and exploitation-exploration balanced strategies, which are supported by results from the three experimental iterations. 3) Unidentified KNN compositions with d 33 > 300 pC/N were identified from approximately 331,000 possibilities whose d 33 values were higher than most compositions in the database.

# CONCLUSION
In this study, we developed a data-driven framework to accelerate the design and discovery of KNN-based ceramics with enhanced piezoelectric properties. We investigated the key factors that affected the d 33 of KNN piezoceramics, which may contribute to a better understanding of the composition-property relationship in the KNN system. We conducted comprehensive ML modelling to establish a predictive model for the piezoelectricity of KNN-based materials. The validated SVR_r model demonstrated good accuracy and generalisability. We further demonstrated the integration of global optimisation methods to efficiently guide experiments based on ML predictions. Finally, our experimentally synthesised samples with d 33 values > 300 pC/N confirmed the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed methods. Our findings demonstrate that ML methods not only enable accurate predictions of material properties but also expedite the discovery of novel functional materials with tailored properties.
