# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was utilized to examine the structural properties of the carbon compounds. The XRD patterns for GO and rGO are displayed in. Graphite exhibited a prominent and sharp diffraction peak at 2\u03b8 = 26.5\xb0, corresponding to the d002 interlayer spacing of 0.34 nm, as determined by the Bragg equation. In contrast, the GO XRD pattern showed a peak at 2\u03b8 = 10.2\xb0, indicating a d001 interlayer spacing of 0.9 nm.. This increase in interlayer spacing is due to the incorporation of oxygen-containing functional groups (hydroxyl, epoxy, carbonyl, and carboxyl) on the planes and edges of the graphite structure, confirming the complete oxidation of graphite to GO. During ultrasonication, the characteristic graphite oxide peak (001) at 2\u03b8 = 10.2\xb0 disappeared, indicating that the van der Waals bonds between adjacent GO layers had been broken, resulting in the complete exfoliation of the graphene oxide. The results showed significant variation in Young's modulus across different compositions presented in (response 1). These differences highlight the impact of composite formulation on mechanical properties, with Run 4 exhibiting the highest stiffness at 19.6 GPa and Run 3 the lowest at 1.84 GPa. To assess how the composites generate electrical voltage in response to applied mechanical strain, which is crucial for evaluating their energy harvesting performance. presents the output voltage results of different BiTO/Chitosan/rGO composites during the energy harvesting test. The maximum response is attributed to Run 4, which corresponds to a ceramic weight percentage of 50 % and a graphene weight percentage of 0.5 %, indicating a combination for maximizing the piezoelectric effect. In contrast, the minimum voltage value was observed in Run 3, where the absence of ceramic means no piezoelectric response. These results highlight the critical role of BiTO in generating an electrical response. , b providing a clearer comparison of peak voltages for each run. The electrical conductivity and piezoelectric coefficient d33 of the elaborated composites are also presented in. As shown in the experimental results for optimizing the piezoelectric composite response , the weight percentage of the ceramic Bi4Ti3O12 and graphene have distinct effects on the final response of our piezoelectric material BiTO/Ch/rGO. These experimental data were used to compute the coefficient of the polynomial equation, which was then used to predict the values of the response variables. presents regression equations for various responses in terms of uncoded values obtained through RSM. ANOVA analyses show that the experimental data fits a quadratic polynomial model. According to the ANOVA all regression model parameters have a probability (p) of less than 0.001, and therefore show no lack of fit. The regression coefficients for each model  were generally greater than 0.95. For Composite young's modulus Composite piezoelectric coefficient and Composite voltage output the coefficients were around 0.9. The predicted RE^{2} was around 0.7 for Composite electric. An RE^{2} value close to unity indicates that the empirical model is better fitted to the real data. A lower RE^{2} value indicates that the dependent variables are less effective that explaining behavioral variation (Henika, 1982). The difference between adjusted and predicted RE^{2} was consistently less than 0.2, indicating that the models accurately fit the experimental data. The experimental results from the design of experiments study demonstrate a clear relationship between ceramic and graphene weight percentages and the young's modulus of the BiTO/Ch/rGO composite. Variations in graphene weight percentage within the tested range had a lesser impact on young's modulus, the critical role of Bi4Ti3O12 ceramic in reducing flexibility was evident. Experimental design results show that absence of ceramic lead to an absence of a piezoelectric response (d33 = 0), while an increase in ceramic weight percentage resulted in an increase in the piezoelectric coefficient d33, reflecting an enhanced piezoelectric effect. Graphene weight percentage variations showed fluctuations in the d33 coefficient, the ceramic component primarily drove the piezoelectric response, with graphene content having a more subtle impact on the composite's piezoelectric properties. Kim et al. developed dielectric nanocomposites using poly(vinylidene) fluoride (PVDF), BaTiO3, and multiwall carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The CNTs were utilized both as a surfactant for BaTiO3 and as an electrically conductive filler. This approach led to enhanced permittivity and dielectric constant due to improved BaTiO3 dispersion and a reduced loss tangent. In , from row 3 to row 4, with the rGO content fixed at 0.5 wt%, the addition of 50 wt% BiTO resulted in a two-order increase in conductivity. This increase can be attributed to the synergistic interaction between the ceramic phase (BiTO) and the graphene phase. The high content of BiTO may lead to the formation of conductive pathways or the enhancement of percolation networks within the composite. The presence of rGO, known for its conductive properties, might assist in connecting these conductive pathways, thus contributing to the observed increase in conductivity. Equation illustrates the relationship between the electric field (Ec) acting on ceramic particles and their dielectric constants in a composite with a piezoceramic filler embedded in a polymer matrix. where \u03b5p and \u03b5c are the dielectric constants of the polymer and ceramic, respectively; E0 represents the electric field applied to the composite. Response optimization was carried out on piezoelectric ceramic weight percentage and graphene weight percentage based on the four measured responses (the composite young's modulus, piezoelectric coefficient d33, conductivity, and output voltage). According to the optimization plot (shown in ), the optimum formula selected is the one prepared using a piezoelectric ceramic weight percentage of 33.27 %, and graphene weight percentage of 0.8 % for 12.65 V for harvested voltage and 12.28 MPa for the composite young's modulus. Four experiments were conducted to validate the predicted values obtained using response surface methodology. presents the experimental values at the compromised level: 11.95 \xb1 0.27 MPa for young's modulus, 18.75 \xb1 3.44 for piezoelectric coefficient, and 12.05 \xb1 0.52 V for harvested output voltage. In a 0\u20133 piezoelectric composite like Bi4Ti3O12/Chitosan/graphene, the distribution influences the interfacial interactions between the ceramic, graphene, and polymer phases, affecting factors such as electron transfer, mechanical coupling, and polarization alignment. The distribution of BiTO particles and the rGO nanoplatelets in the chitosan matrix is presented in. The SEM and element mapping results showed that an optimum BiTO/Ch/rGO contents of 35 % wt% had a well-dispersed distribution. The element mapping images of the composite contain high levels of Ti, Bi, O corresponding to the Bi4Ti3O12 particles and C element corresponding to the nanoplates of reduced graphene. These EDX mapping results also confirm the good dispersion of the ceramic and graphene into the chitosan matrix without significant aggregation. To address this issue, a pre-dispersion through ultrasonication in a solvent proves to be an effective approach before incorporating the constituent elements of our composite, namely the chitosan and Bi4Ti3O12 ceramic.

# ABSTRACT
This study focuses on the development of a novel 0–3 bio-piezoelectric composite utilizing bismuth titanate (Bi4Ti3O12) as the piezoelectric ceramic, chitosan as the polymer matrix, and graphene as a doping element. The primary objective of this study was to study the relationship between the mechanical, piezoelectric, and electrical properties within the developed 0–3 bio-piezoelectric composite. By systematically varying the weight percentages of bismuth titanate ceramic and graphene, our aim was to gain a comprehensive understanding of how these variations influence key properties such as young's modulus for flexibility, the piezoelectric coefficient d33, electrical conductivity, and voltage output. Response surface methodology (RSM) was specifically utilized to model the composite response, optimizing process variables through statistical and mathematical analyses. The optimum formula selected is the one prepared using a piezoelectric ceramic weight percentage of 35,07 %, and graphene weight percentage of 0.9 % for a harvested voltage equal to 12,05 V. The Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) Images of the optimized composite system revealed the uniform distribution of the fillers in the polymer matrix. The optimized composite design resulting from this systematic investigation holds significant promise for practical applications in energy harvesting and sensor technologies, aligning with the demands of Industry 4.0 and IoT technologies.

# INTRODUCTION
In Industry 4.0, these materials are key to enhancing manufacturing and industrial processes by converting ambient mechanical vibrations into electrical energy, powering wireless sensor networks, and enabling real-time data collection for predictive maintenance. This adaptability supports the integration of piezoelectric materials into a wide range of machinery and structures, advancing the development of self-powered sensors, improving human-machine interactions, and enhancing the smart capabilities of industrial systems in line with Industry 4.0 principles. The configuration of these composites is crucial to their performance, with the 0\u20133 composite arrangement, where piezoelectric ceramic particles are dispersed throughout a continuous polymer matrix, being particularly noteworthy. A significant challenge in piezoelectric 0\u20133 composites is the inefficient charge transfer caused by the considerable difference in dielectric properties between the polymer matrix and the piezoelectric ceramic. In the present work, the aim is to develop a novel 0\u20133 bio-piezoelectric composite using bismuth titanate as the piezoelectric ceramic, chitosan as the polymer matrix, and graphene as a doping element to enhance the composite's electrical properties. The novelty of this study lies in the development of a new piezoelectric material that integrates a lead-free ceramic (Bi4Ti3O12), a biopolymer (chitosan), and a conductive element (rGO). Our study utilizes Response Surface Methodology (RSM) to model the response of the BiTO/Ch/rGO composite. RSM is a combination of statistical and mathematical techniques aimed at optimizing a process response that depends on multiple input variables. Among the most commonly used response surface designs are the Central Composite Design (CCD) and the Box-Behnken Design (BBD). CCD, which is applicable for two or more variables, typically involves five levels for each variable but can be adjusted to a face-centered CCD by setting the axial distance "\u237a" to one. BBD, on the other hand, is suitable for at least three variables and always uses three levels for each.

# CONCLUSION
The development and optimization of a 0\u20133 bio-piezoelectric composite using bismuth titanate, chitosan, and graphene represent a significant step forward in the field of piezoelectric materials.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was utilized to examine the structural properties of the carbon compounds. The XRD patterns for GO and rGO are displayed in. Graphite exhibited a prominent and sharp diffraction peak at 2\u03b8 = 26.5\xb0, corresponding to the d002 interlayer spacing of 0.34 nm, as determined by the Bragg equation. In contrast, the GO XRD pattern showed a peak at 2\u03b8 = 10.2\xb0, indicating a d001 interlayer spacing of 0.9 nm.. This increase in interlayer spacing is due to the incorporation of oxygen-containing functional groups (hydroxyl, epoxy, carbonyl, and carboxyl) on the planes and edges of the graphite structure, confirming the complete oxidation of graphite to GO. During ultrasonication, the characteristic graphite oxide peak (001) at 2\u03b8 = 10.2\xb0 disappeared, indicating that the van der Waals bonds between adjacent GO layers had been broken, resulting in the complete exfoliation of the graphene oxide. The results showed significant variation in Young's modulus across different compositions presented in (response 1). These differences highlight the impact of composite formulation on mechanical properties, with Run 4 exhibiting the highest stiffness at 19.6 GPa and Run 3 the lowest at 1.84 GPa. To assess how the composites generate electrical voltage in response to applied mechanical strain, which is crucial for evaluating their energy harvesting performance. presents the output voltage results of different BiTO/Chitosan/rGO composites during the energy harvesting test. The maximum response is attributed to Run 4, which corresponds to a ceramic weight percentage of 50 % and a graphene weight percentage of 0.5 %, indicating a combination for maximizing the piezoelectric effect. In contrast, the minimum voltage value was observed in Run 3, where the absence of ceramic means no piezoelectric response. These results highlight the critical role of BiTO in generating an electrical response. , b providing a clearer comparison of peak voltages for each run. The electrical conductivity and piezoelectric coefficient d33 of the elaborated composites are also presented in. As shown in the experimental results for optimizing the piezoelectric composite response , the weight percentage of the ceramic Bi4Ti3O12 and graphene have distinct effects on the final response of our piezoelectric material BiTO/Ch/rGO. These experimental data were used to compute the coefficient of the polynomial equation, which was then used to predict the values of the response variables. presents regression equations for various responses in terms of uncoded values obtained through RSM. ANOVA analyses show that the experimental data fits a quadratic polynomial model. According to the ANOVA all regression model parameters have a probability (p) of less than 0.001, and therefore show no lack of fit. The regression coefficients for each model  were generally greater than 0.95. For Composite young's modulus Composite piezoelectric coefficient and Composite voltage output the coefficients were around 0.9. The predicted RE^{2} was around 0.7 for Composite electric. An RE^{2} value close to unity indicates that the empirical model is better fitted to the real data. A lower RE^{2} value indicates that the dependent variables are less effective that explaining behavioral variation (Henika, 1982). The difference between adjusted and predicted RE^{2} was consistently less than 0.2, indicating that the models accurately fit the experimental data. The experimental results from the design of experiments study demonstrate a clear relationship between ceramic and graphene weight percentages and the young's modulus of the BiTO/Ch/rGO composite. Variations in graphene weight percentage within the tested range had a lesser impact on young's modulus, the critical role of Bi4Ti3O12 ceramic in reducing flexibility was evident. Experimental design results show that absence of ceramic lead to an absence of a piezoelectric response (d33 = 0), while an increase in ceramic weight percentage resulted in an increase in the piezoelectric coefficient d33, reflecting an enhanced piezoelectric effect. Graphene weight percentage variations showed fluctuations in the d33 coefficient, the ceramic component primarily drove the piezoelectric response, with graphene content having a more subtle impact on the composite's piezoelectric properties. Kim et al. developed dielectric nanocomposites using poly(vinylidene) fluoride (PVDF), BaTiO3, and multiwall carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The CNTs were utilized both as a surfactant for BaTiO3 and as an electrically conductive filler. This approach led to enhanced permittivity and dielectric constant due to improved BaTiO3 dispersion and a reduced loss tangent. In , from row 3 to row 4, with the rGO content fixed at 0.5 wt%, the addition of 50 wt% BiTO resulted in a two-order increase in conductivity. This increase can be attributed to the synergistic interaction between the ceramic phase (BiTO) and the graphene phase. The high content of BiTO may lead to the formation of conductive pathways or the enhancement of percolation networks within the composite. The presence of rGO, known for its conductive properties, might assist in connecting these conductive pathways, thus contributing to the observed increase in conductivity. Equation illustrates the relationship between the electric field (Ec) acting on ceramic particles and their dielectric constants in a composite with a piezoceramic filler embedded in a polymer matrix. where \u03b5p and \u03b5c are the dielectric constants of the polymer and ceramic, respectively; E0 represents the electric field applied to the composite. Response optimization was carried out on piezoelectric ceramic weight percentage and graphene weight percentage based on the four measured responses (the composite young's modulus, piezoelectric coefficient d33, conductivity, and output voltage). According to the optimization plot (shown in ), the optimum formula selected is the one prepared using a piezoelectric ceramic weight percentage of 33.27 %, and graphene weight percentage of 0.8 % for 12.65 V for harvested voltage and 12.28 MPa for the composite young's modulus. Four experiments were conducted to validate the predicted values obtained using response surface methodology. presents the experimental values at the compromised level: 11.95 \xb1 0.27 MPa for young's modulus, 18.75 \xb1 3.44 for piezoelectric coefficient, and 12.05 \xb1 0.52 V for harvested output voltage. In a 0\u20133 piezoelectric composite like Bi4Ti3O12/Chitosan/graphene, the distribution influences the interfacial interactions between the ceramic, graphene, and polymer phases, affecting factors such as electron transfer, mechanical coupling, and polarization alignment. The distribution of BiTO particles and the rGO nanoplatelets in the chitosan matrix is presented in. The SEM and element mapping results showed that an optimum BiTO/Ch/rGO contents of 35 % wt% had a well-dispersed distribution. The element mapping images of the composite contain high levels of Ti, Bi, O corresponding to the Bi4Ti3O12 particles and C element corresponding to the nanoplates of reduced graphene. These EDX mapping results also confirm the good dispersion of the ceramic and graphene into the chitosan matrix without significant aggregation. To address this issue, a pre-dispersion through ultrasonication in a solvent proves to be an effective approach before incorporating the constituent elements of our composite, namely the chitosan and Bi4Ti3O12 ceramic.

# ABSTRACT
This study focuses on the development of a novel 0–3 bio-piezoelectric composite utilizing bismuth titanate (Bi4Ti3O12) as the piezoelectric ceramic, chitosan as the polymer matrix, and graphene as a doping element. The primary objective of this study was to study the relationship between the mechanical, piezoelectric, and electrical properties within the developed 0–3 bio-piezoelectric composite. By systematically varying the weight percentages of bismuth titanate ceramic and graphene, our aim was to gain a comprehensive understanding of how these variations influence key properties such as young's modulus for flexibility, the piezoelectric coefficient d33, electrical conductivity, and voltage output. Response surface methodology (RSM) was specifically utilized to model the composite response, optimizing process variables through statistical and mathematical analyses. The optimum formula selected is the one prepared using a piezoelectric ceramic weight percentage of 35,07 %, and graphene weight percentage of 0.9 % for a harvested voltage equal to 12,05 V. The Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) Images of the optimized composite system revealed the uniform distribution of the fillers in the polymer matrix. The optimized composite design resulting from this systematic investigation holds significant promise for practical applications in energy harvesting and sensor technologies, aligning with the demands of Industry 4.0 and IoT technologies.

# INTRODUCTION
In Industry 4.0, these materials are key to enhancing manufacturing and industrial processes by converting ambient mechanical vibrations into electrical energy, powering wireless sensor networks, and enabling real-time data collection for predictive maintenance. This adaptability supports the integration of piezoelectric materials into a wide range of machinery and structures, advancing the development of self-powered sensors, improving human-machine interactions, and enhancing the smart capabilities of industrial systems in line with Industry 4.0 principles. The configuration of these composites is crucial to their performance, with the 0\u20133 composite arrangement, where piezoelectric ceramic particles are dispersed throughout a continuous polymer matrix, being particularly noteworthy. A significant challenge in piezoelectric 0\u20133 composites is the inefficient charge transfer caused by the considerable difference in dielectric properties between the polymer matrix and the piezoelectric ceramic. In the present work, the aim is to develop a novel 0\u20133 bio-piezoelectric composite using bismuth titanate as the piezoelectric ceramic, chitosan as the polymer matrix, and graphene as a doping element to enhance the composite's electrical properties. The novelty of this study lies in the development of a new piezoelectric material that integrates a lead-free ceramic (Bi4Ti3O12), a biopolymer (chitosan), and a conductive element (rGO). Our study utilizes Response Surface Methodology (RSM) to model the response of the BiTO/Ch/rGO composite. RSM is a combination of statistical and mathematical techniques aimed at optimizing a process response that depends on multiple input variables. Among the most commonly used response surface designs are the Central Composite Design (CCD) and the Box-Behnken Design (BBD). CCD, which is applicable for two or more variables, typically involves five levels for each variable but can be adjusted to a face-centered CCD by setting the axial distance "\u237a" to one. BBD, on the other hand, is suitable for at least three variables and always uses three levels for each.

# CONCLUSION
The development and optimization of a 0\u20133 bio-piezoelectric composite using bismuth titanate, chitosan, and graphene represent a significant step forward in the field of piezoelectric materials.
