# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The hexagonal BFO has a typical perovskite crystal structure, which not only has a typical piezoelectric response but also possesses a favorable photoresponse. The XRD pattern of BFO, ultrathin CdS nanosheets and BC10, BC20, BC30 composite samples prepared by the liquid-phase method as can be seen in a. The XRD patterns of composite samples presented characteristic diffraction peaks of BFO (JCPDS #72\u20132035) and CdS (JCPDF #89\u20132944). It is possible to find that the diffraction peaks of all BFO samples in both pristine samples and composite samples are sharp and intense, indicating that the prepared BFO catalysts are highly crystalline. Besides, no impurity phases such as Bi2O3 and Fe3O4 are generated. The BFO-containing samples generate the intensest characteristic peak at 32.1\xb0, which corresponds to the (110) crystal plane of the hexagonal crystal system for BFO. Meanwhile the CdS nanosheets prepared by liquid-phase precipitation method not only have a wider half-peak width at the same time (002) crystalline planes present at 26.5\xb0 are much more selectively oriented than the other crystalline planes, which may play a pivotal effect on the carrier transport rate of the composite samples. The XRD diffraction peaks of each sample did not show impurity peaks, indicating that the composite photocatalysts with different ratios have been successfully prepared and the two components are well compatible. The chemical composition and chemical state on the surface of each catalyst sample are then further characterised using XPS testing techniques to demonstrate the influence of the strong interaction between BFO and CdS and the construction of heterojunctions on electron transportation. The full spectra of BFO, CdS and BC20 composite catalysts are shown in (b), the elements Bi, Fe and O are present in BFO, the elements Cd and S are present in CdS, and BC20 samples contain all these five elements at the same time. The Bi 4 f peaks located at 158.4 eV and 163.7 eV in the XPS spectrum of BFO originate from Bi 4 f7/2 and Bi 4 f5/2, respectively , and these two binding energy peak positions are consistent with those of BFO in the full spectrum as shown in c. However, these two peak positions corresponding to BC20 are shifted to 159.3 eV and 164.6 eV, respectively. There are two characteristic peaks in the Fe 2p XPS pattern of BFO with binding energies of 724.1 eV and 710.7 eV, which originate from the binding energies of Fe 2p1/2 and Fe 2p3/2, respectively. There is a satellite peak (\u223c717.3 eV) at 4.8 eV higher than the binding energy of Fe 2p3/2, which indicates that the Fe element in the material exists in the form of FeE^{3+} ions rather than FeE^{2+} ions. The binding energy of Fe element in the composite sample is shifted to higher energy levels by 3.2 eV similarly to that of the Bi element. It is noteworthy that the O 1 s characteristic peaks of BC20 composites correspond to lattice oxygen at low energy level, reactive oxygen at intermediate energy level and adsorbed oxygen at the high energy level, respectively. This indicates that the construction of heterojunction between BFO and CdS effectively enhanced the surface redox reaction ability of the catalyst. The high-resolution XPS spectra of Cd 3d of CdS and BC20 samples consist with two characteristic peaks of Cd 3d5/2 and Cd 3d3/2 locate at 404.4 and 411.2 eV, respectively. The characteristic peaks of Cd 3d in the formed heterojunction composites are shifted to the lower energy level by 0.5 eV with a tendency to gain electrons. In contrast, the change in S 2p binding energy is not very pronounced, suggesting that the electron mobility in the heterojunction composites is more favorable from BFO to the metal cation around CdE^{2+}. The individual catalyst samples were characterised and analysed by SEM to investigate the size, morphology and contact method of the prepared samples. As can be seen in a, the synthesised BFO particles are distributed in the range of 100\u2013300 nm with the smooth surface of the material having spindle and ellipsoidal particle shapes. The SEM images of the BFO/CdS composite samples with CdS nanosheets gradually encapsulate on the surface of BFO particles are shown in c\u2013e. With the gradual increase in the mass fraction of CdS, BC20 is more fully distributed on the BFO surface due to the elevated percentage of nanoflowering CdS. The particulate BFO as a carrier of CdS enabled BC20 not only to have a higher contact area than BC10, but also inhibited the agglomeration of CdS, thus showing better dispersion. However, when the mass fraction of CdS is too high, the CdS nanosheets in the surface layer of BC30 have certain agglomeration phenomena and are no longer as unfolded as that of BC20, which may adversely affect the mass transfer of the reaction system. Subsequently, in order to demonstrate the successful preparation and dispersion of the composite BFO/CdS samples, EDS mapping of the elemental distribution in the BC20 samples was carried out. It can be seen that the distribution profiles of Bi and Fe elements are consistent with the sample morphology in f, which is due to the fact that the main structure of BC20 is composed of BFO. Further, the atomic percentage matches with the synthesised composite catalysts not only confirms the successful preparation of the samples in XRD, but also indicates the good dispersion of the samples. In order to investigate the morphology characteristics and composite patterns of the heterojunction composite catalysts, BC20 was observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Besides, to investigate the electron flow between the two components, 1 wt% of Pt particles were loaded on the sample surface by photo deposition through H2PtCl6\xb76H2O precursor. a shows the obvious two-phase interface connection between the BFO of the bulk structure and the lamellar CdS. On the basis of HRTEM in b, it is observed that Pt microparticles are selectively deployed on the edge active sites of CdS nanosheets, which confirms that the electrons between the two components are transferred from BFO to CdS and reduced by the active sites of CdS. According to HRTEM b, it can be found that Pt nanoparticles are selectively deposited on the edge active sites of CdS nanosheets, which confirms that the electrons between the two components are transferred from BFO to CdS and reduced by the active sites of CdS. It is further found that the CdS nanosheets are preferentially oriented to the (002) lattice plane by d, which in agreement with the results in the XRD spectra. For the purpose of determining the effect of the introduction of non-homogeneous structured CdS nanosheets on the pore structure of the composites, N2 adsorption-desorption curves were employed to characterise the variation in the pore structure of the pristine BFO, CdS, and BFO/CdS composite photocatalysts with different mass ratios. The isothermal N2 adsorption-desorption curves of each catalyst are shown in a. All the samples exhibit Langmuir type IV isotherms except BFO crystals, which contain H3-type hysteresis lines. Based on the classification criteria of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) , which indicates that the material contains a high number of micropores in addition to mesopores. The pore size distribution in b also confirms this view, and when the mass fraction of CdS reaches 20 %, the porosity of the sample is not only much higher than that of the pristine BFO but also the highest among all composite samples. The reaction medium in solution is affected by the adsorption of high specific surface area CdS coating on the surface of BFO, which transforms the original free motion in three-dimensional space into restricted two-dimensional planar motion. Also noteworthy is the porosity of the BC30 sample is rather unsatisfactory with the agglomeration of CdS, which substantiates the observation of the phenomenon in the SEM. With the aim of investigating the photocatalytic performance of BFO/CdS heterojunction composites, the catalytic hydrogen evolution performance of catalysts with different composite ratios was tested and compared under visible-light irradiation in light-only, ultrasonic-only, and light coupled ultrasonic environments, respectively. Na2S/Na2SO3 mixed solution was used as the sacrificial agent. The amount of hydrogen production versus time and the rate of hydrogen production for pristine BFO, pristine CdS and BFO/CdS heterojunction composites with different mass ratios under the effect of light-only conditions are shown in a and b. The pristine BFO is limited by its excessive grain size that makes carriers transport in the bulk phase difficult, which in turn makes its hydrogen production performance unsatisfactory. Meanwhile, the pristine CdS phase accelerates the photogenerated carrier transport rate due to its thin-layer structure and high specific surface area, which not only benefits the adsorption of reactants and desorption of hydrogen, resulting in a hydrogen production rate of 0.54 mmol\xb7gE^{\u22121}\xb7hE^{\u22121} under visible light irradiation. The hydrogen production rates of all composites are higher than those of pristine BFO and CdS, with BC20 having a hydrogen evolution rate of 1.31 mmol\xb7gE^{\u22121}\xb7hE^{\u22121}, a factor of 42.81 higher than that of pristine BFO. This not only confirms that its photocatalytic performance is related to the specific surface area as well as the separation efficiency of its photogenerated electron-hole pairs, but also demonstrates that the construction of the heterojunction formed between BFO and CdS effectively accelerates the separation of photogenerated carriers. Moreover, the spindle and ellipsoidal particle structure of the pristine BFO leads to a much lower frequency and degree of deformation than that of CdS with a 2D lamellar structure, which results in a relatively low piezoelectric catalytic activity. In particular, the hydrogen production rate of 3.58 mmol\xb7gE^{\u22121}\xb7hE^{\u22121} can be achieved by BC20 under the effect of multi-field coupling. The reaction of multi-field coupled catalytic pure water splitting is relatively slow in the initial stage due to the limitation of the four-electron reaction at the oxidation end, while there is a significant increase after 2 h and the hydrogen production rate of BC20 can reach 0.19 mmol\xb7gE^{\u22121}\xb7hE^{\u22121}. Additionally, the composite morphology of CdS nanosheets loaded on the BFO surface has a rougher surface and richer pore structure. Since the stable perovskite crystal structure of BFO allows for good chemical stability, in turn, the easy photo-corrosive CdS was used for comparison with BC20. The Catalytic stability test of pristine CdS and BC20 under ultrasonic vibration and visible-light irradiation coupling conditions with sacrificial agent is shown in i. It can be found that BC20 has a good chemical stability, decaying only 10.1 % under 5 cycles of reaction. In contrast, the hydrogen production activity of pristine CdS decays by 31.7 % under 5 cycles, which is a significant decrease compared with BC20. The construction of Z-Scheme heterojunction can improve the stability of the composites by trapping photogenerated holes through BFO. As shown in j, the hydrogen production cycle stability of pure water splitting by pristine CdS decays to 68.8 % after 5 cycles due to the excessive accumulation of photogenerated cavities on the surface , which much lower than that under the reaction system containing sacrificial agent (31.7 %), suggesting that the utilisation of the Na2S/Na2SO3 sacrificial agent is able to lower the thermodynamic barrier to H2O splitting as well as reduce the degree of photocorrosion of the catalyst. The XRD of BC20 before and after the reaction under the conditions of pure water and sacrificial agent is shown in , the position of the diffraction peaks of BC20 did not change after the reaction, and the intensity of the peaks is slightly weakened, which indicates that its crystallinity has decreased. This is also the reason why the activity of BC20 decreased after 5 cycles, but the overall catalytic activity remained high. There is a strong synergistic effect between sulfur compound photocatalysts and OHE^{-} anions, and in the absence of hole sacrificers, OHE^{-} can also greatly contribute to the surface kinetics of hole release and water decomposition. The \xb7OH is the main product of the water oxidation half-reaction in the presence of OHE^{-}. The composite photocatalysts show the higher photocatalytic activity than the pristine single-phase catalysts, which can be attributed to the construction of BFO/CdS heterostructures and the good interfacial contact between them to improve the photogenerated carriers separation efficiency. The light absorption capacity of the pristine BFO, CdS and heterojunction composite catalysts can be seen by UV-Vis absorbance spectra in a. All of the samples have excellent visible light absorption capacity, and the composites all show stronger light absorption performance than the pristine BFO or CdS in the wavelength range higher than 390 nm. The bandgap of BFO and CdS were estimated to be 2.13 eV and 2.51 eV respectively based on UV-Vis absorbance spectra combined with the Tauc equation as can be seen in b. The band structure of the two component samples constituting the heterojunction was further clarified by the Mott-Schottky test and the frequency was set to 800 and 1000 Hz. The slope of the Mott-Schottky curve for BFO can be found to be negative through c , while it is positive for CdS in d. Therefore, the prepared BFO is a p-type semiconductor while CdS is an n-type semiconductor. The intersection of the different frequency linear parts of the Mott-Schottky diagram shows the flat band potential location, which corresponds to 1.42 and \u22121.26 eV vs Ag/AgCl for BFO and CdS, respectively. The flat band locations of the prepared BFO and CdS were transformed via the Nernst equation (E RHE = E Ag/AgCl + 0.059 \xd7 pH + E E^{ } Ag/AgCl ) to 2.02 eV and \u22120.66 eV for the standard hydrogen electrode potential. For the standard hydrogen electrode, the E VB for p-type semiconductors is very close to the flat band potential value, while the E CB for n-type semiconductors is very close to the flat band potential value. Therefore, the VB position of BFO is 2.02 eV and the CB position of CdS is \u22120.66 eV, and the corresponding conduction band or valence band positions can be deduced from E CB =E VB -E g. Toward investigating the impact of heterogeneous structure construction of BC20 composites on the degree of carrier recombination, the transfer of photogenerated carriers was probed by the photoluminescence properties (PL) and the results are shown in e. The PL peak intensities of BFO/CdS are all decreased to different degrees compared with those of the pristine samples, indicating that the successful fabrication of heterojunction can be effective to inhibit the internal recombination of photogenerated carriers in the composite samples. It is noteworthy that the emission peaks of the heterojunction composites are significantly shifted to higher wavelengths compared with those of the pure BFOs, suggesting that the bandgap and the surface states of the heterojunction composites are changed. In addition, the heterojunction between 2D materials and nanoparticles may lead to tighter contacts between layered CdS and BFO as well as more efficient separation of electron-hole pairs. The photocurrent density and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests were performed to verify the charge transfer and electrochemical properties of the heterojunction composites. As shown in f and g, the highest photocurrent intensity possessed by BC20 further proves that it has the highest separation efficiency for photogenerated carriers. The charge transfer resistance of the heterojunction composite samples is significantly reduced compared with that of pristine BFO and CdS by comparing the electrochemical impedance spectra. BC20 corresponds to the smallest diameter of the semicircular arcs of the impedance spectra indicating that the fastest charge transfer rate is achieved. To more visually confirm whether this heterojunction follows a Z-scheme reaction route as well as to identify the reaction intermediate reactive species, it was investigated by electron paramagnetic resonance (ESR) spin trapping spectroscopy of DMPO-\xb7OH measured in aqueous suspensions of the BC20 composite samples and DMPO-\xb7O2 E^{-} measured in methanol suspensions. The characteristic peaks of \xb7OH and \xb7O2 E^{-} radicals were all detected in BC20 composite samples under xenon lamp irradiation. The CB position of CdS is more negative than the redox potential of O2/\xb7O2 E^{-} (-0.33 eV vs RHE ). Therefore, it can provide electrons to produce \xb7O2 E^{-}. However, the VB position of CdS is more negative than the oxidation potential of \xb7OH/OHE^{-} (1.90 eV vs. RHE ), which prevents it from oxidizing OHE^{-} to \xb7OH. On the contrary, in contrast, the VB and CB positions of BFO are more positive than \xb7OH/OHE^{-} and O2/\xb7O2 E^{-}, which ensures its ability to oxidize OHE^{-} to \xb7OH but without \xb7O2 E^{-}. Based on the above analysis, if the heterojunction of BFO/CdS is type-II, it is unable to produce \xb7OH or \xb7O2 E^{-} radicals. The Z-scheme heterojunction composed of BFO/CdS retains the more reducing CB of CdS and the more oxidizing VB of BFO are retained to obtain a more effective redox capacity. To further explore the piezoelectricity of the pristine BFO, pristine CdS and heterojunction composites more intuitively, the piezoelectric coefficient (d33), piezoelectric current and piezoelectric voltage of each sample are shown in. The piezoelectric coefficients d33 of pristine BFO, CdS and composite samples with different ratios were measured to be 17.04, 20.24, 26.48, 35.2 and 29.5 pC\xb7NE^{\u22121}, respectively, by the preparation of thin films for each sample. In the stressed state, the top and bottom surfaces of the catalyst films have different potentials and the potential difference was measured to be 0.15, 0.21, 0.32, 0.51, and 0.39 V for BFO, CdS and each of the heterojunction composites, respectively (b). The measured output currents are shown in c, with 0.031, 0.039, 0.056, 0.078 and 0.125 \xb5A for each catalyst sample under cyclic compression. It is evident that both BFO/CdS heterojunction composites exhibit higher piezoelectric generation performance than pristine BFO or CdS. As the center displacements of negative and positive ions (bound charges) in the single-phase crystal are lower than the Curie temperature, the spontaneous polarisation induced by external forces results in an internal electrostatic field within the BFO and CdS domains, which leads to the directional separation of free charges and photogenerated carriers in the catalysts with a piezoelectric response. In order to further investigate the electron transfer pathways between the two components of BFO/CdS composites with different energy bands interleaved, the work function of the samples was calculated using density flood theory (DFT). The formula is expressed as W= Evac-EF, where Evac denotes the vacuum energy level of the material and EF denotes the Fermi energy level of the material. As shown in a and b, the work functions of BFO and CdS are 2.67 and 4.65 eV, respectively, and thus the Fermi energy level of BFO is higher than that of CdS. When the two single-phase materials contact at the interface to form a heterojunction, the electrons will be transferred from BFO to CdS. At the same time, a internal electric field is formed from the surface of CdS to the surface of BFO. Until the Fermi energy level reaches the equilibrium value, the work function of the BFO/CdS composite is 4.23 eV, which results in the formation of a Z-scheme charge transfer pathway, as shown in c. The formation of Z-Scheme heterojunctions was confirmed by band structure testing and ESR spectroscopy, combined with the electron flow direction confirmed in TEM. The charge transfer schematic of the BFO/CdS heterojunction composite is shown in. Since the EF of CdS is higher than that of BFO, and thus when CdS is in contact with BFO, electrons spontaneously migrate from the CdS surface to the BFO surface, leading to a new EF equilibrium. On the contrary, due to the inflow of electrons, negative charges accumulate at the interface of the BFO, resulting in downward bending of the energy bands Meanwhile, the redistribution of charges at the CdS/BFO interface generates an inbuilt electric field, which facilitates the binding of electrons in the CB of the BFO and holes in the VB of the CdS. Under visible light irradiation, the electrons in the CB of BFO were driven by the internal electric field to complex with the holes in the VB of CdS. Since BFO and CdS are not only photocatalysts but also proved to have excellent piezoelectric response, there is both an interfacial electric field formed by the Z-Scheme heterojunction and a polarisation electric field between the two components. When light and external stress act simultaneously on single components of BFO or CdS catalysts, the piezoelectric potential as a strong driving force can promote the separation of photogenerated carriers from free charges within the bulk phase in piezoelectric photocatalysts. Consequently, the photogenerated electrons in the BFO CB are rapidly transferred through the contact interface, and furthermore, the hydrogen generation reaction is accelerated due to the enhancement of the ferroelectric polarisation of the CdS and the BFO which makes the CB of the CdS sufficiently charged with electrons.

Piezoelectric polarization-induced photogenerated carriers transfer coupled with active electron transport Z-scheme heterojunction synergistic optimization of BiFeO<inf>3</inf>/CdS composite photocatalysts for hydrogen production

# ABSTRACT
In this study, Z-scheme heterostructures with active electron transport properties are constructed with multiferroic BiFeO3 and favorable visible light-responsive CdS nanosheets. The combination of BiFeO3 particles and ultrathin CdS not only suppresses the agglomeration of CdS nanosheets, but also assists in enhancing the specific surface area of the reaction system. The piezoelectric effect possessed by BiFeO3 and CdS leads to the triggering of spontaneous polarisation moments in response to external forces. The hydrogen evolution rate of the composite containing 20 wt% CdS reaches 3.58 mmol·g−1·h−1 under photo-piezoelectric coupling conditions, which is 116.64 fold higher than that of the pristine BiFeO3 under visible light irradiation.

# INTRODUCTION
About 90 % of the photogenerated carriers generated in photocatalytic materials after photoexcitation are rapidly complexed. When a certain wavelength range of light is absorbed by the catalyst, the semiconductor catalyst is excited by light and the electrons migrate from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB) of the catalyst, forming photogenerated electron-hole pairs. Huang et al. have linked the introduction of transition metal cations to the deformation of SiO4 tetrahedra and the generation of polarization fields through the accumulation of SiO4 tetrahedra in Ag6Si2O7. Theoretical calculations show that the photogenerated electron migration from Ag(c)O4 to Ag(b)O3 and then to Ag(a)O2 is consistent with the direction of the internally polarized electric field generated by the polar SiO4 tetrahedral arrangement. Ding et al. surface-modified polymerized carbon nitride (g-C3N4) with a graphite carbon ring to establish an internal electric field that caused light-induced eE^{-} and hE^{+} to move in different directions, thereby increasing the photocatalytic hydrogen production rate by 21 times. Liu et al. used the piezoelectric polarization of BiFeO3 in a core-shell structure to confine the photogenerated electrons and holes of TiO2 to the positive and negative sides of the piezoelectric, respectively. Heterojunction composites composed of semiconductor-semiconductor (S1-S2) are usually most common as type-I and type-II heterojunctions. Type-I heterojunctions consist of two- or multi-component semiconductors in which S2 has a higher CB than S1 and S2 has a lower VB than S1, thus holes and electrons are transferred and accumulate on S1. The photogenerated electron transfer from S2 to S1 in type-II heterojunctions depends on the CB of S2 in a more negative position. On the contrary, holes can migrate from S1 with more positive VB towards S2, resulting in spatial carriers separation and enhanced photocatalytic reactivity. Although the type-II heterojunction performs perfectly in charge separation, there are still some shortcomings. Because the transfer of electrons from higher to lowerenergy level and holes from lower to higher energy level makes the reacting system have a more positive CB and a more negative VB, in thermodynamics this charge transfer mechanism is detrimental to the redox capacity of the reacting system. In terms of energy utilisation, the CB or VB energy difference between S2 and S1 is not involved in the photocatalytic reaction. In relation to the decreasing redox capacity of type-II heterojunctions, Z-scheme heterojunctions have a more suitable charge transfer system for redox reactions. Photogenerated electrons in semiconductor S1 having a low reduction capacity are compounded with photogenerated holes in semiconductor S2 possessing reduced oxidation capacity. Consequently, it is possible to maintain photogenerated electrons in the semiconductor S2 possessing a high reduction capability and photogenerated holes in the semiconductor S1 with a high oxidation capability. It is also important to note that carrier mobilisation for Z-scheme photocatalysts is physiologically more viable than that for type-II heterojunction photocatalysts, since the photogenerated electrons migrating from the CB of the semiconductor S1 to the photogenerated holes VB of the semiconductor S2 are advantageous due to the electrostatic attraction between the electrons and the holes. A direct Z-scheme heterojunction formation between the CdS/WO3 composites prepared by Jin et al. improves carrier separation efficiency, which in turn exhibited a better photocatalytic methane production efficiency. Yu et al. constructed an interfacial linker coordinated heterostructured cadmium sulfide/zirconium-based metal-organic framework (CdS/NU-M) to realize a Z-scheme charge transfer channel in CdS/NU-M. As the photogenerated charges were efficiently separated and transported to the surface, it induced a 10 times higher photocatalytic hydrogen production rate of CdS/NU-M than that of the pure phase photocatalyst. Wu et al. constructed a Z-scheme BiFeO3/Bi2O4 heterostructure by anchoring BiFeO3 nanoparticles to Bi2O4 with a rod structure, and elucidated the charge transfer pathway between BiFeO3 and Bi2O4 based on the band structure and the main active substances. Therefore, the typical piezoelectric photocatalysts CdS and BiFeO3 are used as the research objects in this paper, and the Z-scheme heterojunction composites of BiFeO3 coated with ultrathin CdS are successfully prepared.

# CONCLUSION
In this thesis, BFO/CdS heterojunction composite catalysts are constructed based mainly on the perovskite oxide BFO, and the multiferroic nature of the BFO-based materials is optimised by constructing it with CdS nanosheets. The constructed Z-Scheme heterojunction reduces the recombination of photogenerated carriers and enhances the interfacial charge transportation as well as the adsorption and desorption rates of the reaction medium, as corroborated by band structure calculations, PL spectroscopy, radical trapping experiments, and catalytic hydrogen production performance. In this case, the visible light catalysis hydrogen production rate of BC20 reached 1.31 mmol\xb7gE^{\u22121}\xb7hE^{\u22121}, which is 42.81 times higher than that of the pristine BFO. Further, it is verified that both BFO and CdS have not only a visible light response but also favorable piezoelectricity. It is further revealed that photogenerated electrons and holes are more prone to migrate in the direction of the piezoelectric polarisation field strength of BFO/CdS induction. Meanwhile, the retained more negative CB of CdS and the more positive VB of BFO further optimised the redox capacity of the composite catalysts. The experimental results show that the BC20 composite achieves a hydrogen production rate of 3.58 mmol\xb7gE^{\u22121}\xb7hE^{\u22121} by photo-piezoelectric catalysis in a sacrificial agent environment, and also possesses the ability to deionised water splitting.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The hexagonal BFO has a typical perovskite crystal structure, which not only has a typical piezoelectric response but also possesses a favorable photoresponse. The XRD pattern of BFO, ultrathin CdS nanosheets and BC10, BC20, BC30 composite samples prepared by the liquid-phase method as can be seen in a. The XRD patterns of composite samples presented characteristic diffraction peaks of BFO (JCPDS #72\u20132035) and CdS (JCPDF #89\u20132944). It is possible to find that the diffraction peaks of all BFO samples in both pristine samples and composite samples are sharp and intense, indicating that the prepared BFO catalysts are highly crystalline. Besides, no impurity phases such as Bi2O3 and Fe3O4 are generated. The BFO-containing samples generate the intensest characteristic peak at 32.1\xb0, which corresponds to the (110) crystal plane of the hexagonal crystal system for BFO. Meanwhile the CdS nanosheets prepared by liquid-phase precipitation method not only have a wider half-peak width at the same time (002) crystalline planes present at 26.5\xb0 are much more selectively oriented than the other crystalline planes, which may play a pivotal effect on the carrier transport rate of the composite samples. The XRD diffraction peaks of each sample did not show impurity peaks, indicating that the composite photocatalysts with different ratios have been successfully prepared and the two components are well compatible. The chemical composition and chemical state on the surface of each catalyst sample are then further characterised using XPS testing techniques to demonstrate the influence of the strong interaction between BFO and CdS and the construction of heterojunctions on electron transportation. The full spectra of BFO, CdS and BC20 composite catalysts are shown in (b), the elements Bi, Fe and O are present in BFO, the elements Cd and S are present in CdS, and BC20 samples contain all these five elements at the same time. The Bi 4 f peaks located at 158.4 eV and 163.7 eV in the XPS spectrum of BFO originate from Bi 4 f7/2 and Bi 4 f5/2, respectively , and these two binding energy peak positions are consistent with those of BFO in the full spectrum as shown in c. However, these two peak positions corresponding to BC20 are shifted to 159.3 eV and 164.6 eV, respectively. There are two characteristic peaks in the Fe 2p XPS pattern of BFO with binding energies of 724.1 eV and 710.7 eV, which originate from the binding energies of Fe 2p1/2 and Fe 2p3/2, respectively. There is a satellite peak (\u223c717.3 eV) at 4.8 eV higher than the binding energy of Fe 2p3/2, which indicates that the Fe element in the material exists in the form of FeE^{3+} ions rather than FeE^{2+} ions. The binding energy of Fe element in the composite sample is shifted to higher energy levels by 3.2 eV similarly to that of the Bi element. It is noteworthy that the O 1 s characteristic peaks of BC20 composites correspond to lattice oxygen at low energy level, reactive oxygen at intermediate energy level and adsorbed oxygen at the high energy level, respectively. This indicates that the construction of heterojunction between BFO and CdS effectively enhanced the surface redox reaction ability of the catalyst. The high-resolution XPS spectra of Cd 3d of CdS and BC20 samples consist with two characteristic peaks of Cd 3d5/2 and Cd 3d3/2 locate at 404.4 and 411.2 eV, respectively. The characteristic peaks of Cd 3d in the formed heterojunction composites are shifted to the lower energy level by 0.5 eV with a tendency to gain electrons. In contrast, the change in S 2p binding energy is not very pronounced, suggesting that the electron mobility in the heterojunction composites is more favorable from BFO to the metal cation around CdE^{2+}. The individual catalyst samples were characterised and analysed by SEM to investigate the size, morphology and contact method of the prepared samples. As can be seen in a, the synthesised BFO particles are distributed in the range of 100\u2013300 nm with the smooth surface of the material having spindle and ellipsoidal particle shapes. The SEM images of the BFO/CdS composite samples with CdS nanosheets gradually encapsulate on the surface of BFO particles are shown in c\u2013e. With the gradual increase in the mass fraction of CdS, BC20 is more fully distributed on the BFO surface due to the elevated percentage of nanoflowering CdS. The particulate BFO as a carrier of CdS enabled BC20 not only to have a higher contact area than BC10, but also inhibited the agglomeration of CdS, thus showing better dispersion. However, when the mass fraction of CdS is too high, the CdS nanosheets in the surface layer of BC30 have certain agglomeration phenomena and are no longer as unfolded as that of BC20, which may adversely affect the mass transfer of the reaction system. Subsequently, in order to demonstrate the successful preparation and dispersion of the composite BFO/CdS samples, EDS mapping of the elemental distribution in the BC20 samples was carried out. It can be seen that the distribution profiles of Bi and Fe elements are consistent with the sample morphology in f, which is due to the fact that the main structure of BC20 is composed of BFO. Further, the atomic percentage matches with the synthesised composite catalysts not only confirms the successful preparation of the samples in XRD, but also indicates the good dispersion of the samples. In order to investigate the morphology characteristics and composite patterns of the heterojunction composite catalysts, BC20 was observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Besides, to investigate the electron flow between the two components, 1 wt% of Pt particles were loaded on the sample surface by photo deposition through H2PtCl6\xb76H2O precursor. a shows the obvious two-phase interface connection between the BFO of the bulk structure and the lamellar CdS. On the basis of HRTEM in b, it is observed that Pt microparticles are selectively deployed on the edge active sites of CdS nanosheets, which confirms that the electrons between the two components are transferred from BFO to CdS and reduced by the active sites of CdS. According to HRTEM b, it can be found that Pt nanoparticles are selectively deposited on the edge active sites of CdS nanosheets, which confirms that the electrons between the two components are transferred from BFO to CdS and reduced by the active sites of CdS. It is further found that the CdS nanosheets are preferentially oriented to the (002) lattice plane by d, which in agreement with the results in the XRD spectra. For the purpose of determining the effect of the introduction of non-homogeneous structured CdS nanosheets on the pore structure of the composites, N2 adsorption-desorption curves were employed to characterise the variation in the pore structure of the pristine BFO, CdS, and BFO/CdS composite photocatalysts with different mass ratios. The isothermal N2 adsorption-desorption curves of each catalyst are shown in a. All the samples exhibit Langmuir type IV isotherms except BFO crystals, which contain H3-type hysteresis lines. Based on the classification criteria of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) , which indicates that the material contains a high number of micropores in addition to mesopores. The pore size distribution in b also confirms this view, and when the mass fraction of CdS reaches 20 %, the porosity of the sample is not only much higher than that of the pristine BFO but also the highest among all composite samples. The reaction medium in solution is affected by the adsorption of high specific surface area CdS coating on the surface of BFO, which transforms the original free motion in three-dimensional space into restricted two-dimensional planar motion. Also noteworthy is the porosity of the BC30 sample is rather unsatisfactory with the agglomeration of CdS, which substantiates the observation of the phenomenon in the SEM. With the aim of investigating the photocatalytic performance of BFO/CdS heterojunction composites, the catalytic hydrogen evolution performance of catalysts with different composite ratios was tested and compared under visible-light irradiation in light-only, ultrasonic-only, and light coupled ultrasonic environments, respectively. Na2S/Na2SO3 mixed solution was used as the sacrificial agent. The amount of hydrogen production versus time and the rate of hydrogen production for pristine BFO, pristine CdS and BFO/CdS heterojunction composites with different mass ratios under the effect of light-only conditions are shown in a and b. The pristine BFO is limited by its excessive grain size that makes carriers transport in the bulk phase difficult, which in turn makes its hydrogen production performance unsatisfactory. Meanwhile, the pristine CdS phase accelerates the photogenerated carrier transport rate due to its thin-layer structure and high specific surface area, which not only benefits the adsorption of reactants and desorption of hydrogen, resulting in a hydrogen production rate of 0.54 mmol\xb7gE^{\u22121}\xb7hE^{\u22121} under visible light irradiation. The hydrogen production rates of all composites are higher than those of pristine BFO and CdS, with BC20 having a hydrogen evolution rate of 1.31 mmol\xb7gE^{\u22121}\xb7hE^{\u22121}, a factor of 42.81 higher than that of pristine BFO. This not only confirms that its photocatalytic performance is related to the specific surface area as well as the separation efficiency of its photogenerated electron-hole pairs, but also demonstrates that the construction of the heterojunction formed between BFO and CdS effectively accelerates the separation of photogenerated carriers. Moreover, the spindle and ellipsoidal particle structure of the pristine BFO leads to a much lower frequency and degree of deformation than that of CdS with a 2D lamellar structure, which results in a relatively low piezoelectric catalytic activity. In particular, the hydrogen production rate of 3.58 mmol\xb7gE^{\u22121}\xb7hE^{\u22121} can be achieved by BC20 under the effect of multi-field coupling. The reaction of multi-field coupled catalytic pure water splitting is relatively slow in the initial stage due to the limitation of the four-electron reaction at the oxidation end, while there is a significant increase after 2 h and the hydrogen production rate of BC20 can reach 0.19 mmol\xb7gE^{\u22121}\xb7hE^{\u22121}. Additionally, the composite morphology of CdS nanosheets loaded on the BFO surface has a rougher surface and richer pore structure. Since the stable perovskite crystal structure of BFO allows for good chemical stability, in turn, the easy photo-corrosive CdS was used for comparison with BC20. The Catalytic stability test of pristine CdS and BC20 under ultrasonic vibration and visible-light irradiation coupling conditions with sacrificial agent is shown in i. It can be found that BC20 has a good chemical stability, decaying only 10.1 % under 5 cycles of reaction. In contrast, the hydrogen production activity of pristine CdS decays by 31.7 % under 5 cycles, which is a significant decrease compared with BC20. The construction of Z-Scheme heterojunction can improve the stability of the composites by trapping photogenerated holes through BFO. As shown in j, the hydrogen production cycle stability of pure water splitting by pristine CdS decays to 68.8 % after 5 cycles due to the excessive accumulation of photogenerated cavities on the surface , which much lower than that under the reaction system containing sacrificial agent (31.7 %), suggesting that the utilisation of the Na2S/Na2SO3 sacrificial agent is able to lower the thermodynamic barrier to H2O splitting as well as reduce the degree of photocorrosion of the catalyst. The XRD of BC20 before and after the reaction under the conditions of pure water and sacrificial agent is shown in , the position of the diffraction peaks of BC20 did not change after the reaction, and the intensity of the peaks is slightly weakened, which indicates that its crystallinity has decreased. This is also the reason why the activity of BC20 decreased after 5 cycles, but the overall catalytic activity remained high. There is a strong synergistic effect between sulfur compound photocatalysts and OHE^{-} anions, and in the absence of hole sacrificers, OHE^{-} can also greatly contribute to the surface kinetics of hole release and water decomposition. The \xb7OH is the main product of the water oxidation half-reaction in the presence of OHE^{-}. The composite photocatalysts show the higher photocatalytic activity than the pristine single-phase catalysts, which can be attributed to the construction of BFO/CdS heterostructures and the good interfacial contact between them to improve the photogenerated carriers separation efficiency. The light absorption capacity of the pristine BFO, CdS and heterojunction composite catalysts can be seen by UV-Vis absorbance spectra in a. All of the samples have excellent visible light absorption capacity, and the composites all show stronger light absorption performance than the pristine BFO or CdS in the wavelength range higher than 390 nm. The bandgap of BFO and CdS were estimated to be 2.13 eV and 2.51 eV respectively based on UV-Vis absorbance spectra combined with the Tauc equation as can be seen in b. The band structure of the two component samples constituting the heterojunction was further clarified by the Mott-Schottky test and the frequency was set to 800 and 1000 Hz. The slope of the Mott-Schottky curve for BFO can be found to be negative through c , while it is positive for CdS in d. Therefore, the prepared BFO is a p-type semiconductor while CdS is an n-type semiconductor. The intersection of the different frequency linear parts of the Mott-Schottky diagram shows the flat band potential location, which corresponds to 1.42 and \u22121.26 eV vs Ag/AgCl for BFO and CdS, respectively. The flat band locations of the prepared BFO and CdS were transformed via the Nernst equation (E RHE = E Ag/AgCl + 0.059 \xd7 pH + E E^{ } Ag/AgCl ) to 2.02 eV and \u22120.66 eV for the standard hydrogen electrode potential. For the standard hydrogen electrode, the E VB for p-type semiconductors is very close to the flat band potential value, while the E CB for n-type semiconductors is very close to the flat band potential value. Therefore, the VB position of BFO is 2.02 eV and the CB position of CdS is \u22120.66 eV, and the corresponding conduction band or valence band positions can be deduced from E CB =E VB -E g. Toward investigating the impact of heterogeneous structure construction of BC20 composites on the degree of carrier recombination, the transfer of photogenerated carriers was probed by the photoluminescence properties (PL) and the results are shown in e. The PL peak intensities of BFO/CdS are all decreased to different degrees compared with those of the pristine samples, indicating that the successful fabrication of heterojunction can be effective to inhibit the internal recombination of photogenerated carriers in the composite samples. It is noteworthy that the emission peaks of the heterojunction composites are significantly shifted to higher wavelengths compared with those of the pure BFOs, suggesting that the bandgap and the surface states of the heterojunction composites are changed. In addition, the heterojunction between 2D materials and nanoparticles may lead to tighter contacts between layered CdS and BFO as well as more efficient separation of electron-hole pairs. The photocurrent density and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests were performed to verify the charge transfer and electrochemical properties of the heterojunction composites. As shown in f and g, the highest photocurrent intensity possessed by BC20 further proves that it has the highest separation efficiency for photogenerated carriers. The charge transfer resistance of the heterojunction composite samples is significantly reduced compared with that of pristine BFO and CdS by comparing the electrochemical impedance spectra. BC20 corresponds to the smallest diameter of the semicircular arcs of the impedance spectra indicating that the fastest charge transfer rate is achieved. To more visually confirm whether this heterojunction follows a Z-scheme reaction route as well as to identify the reaction intermediate reactive species, it was investigated by electron paramagnetic resonance (ESR) spin trapping spectroscopy of DMPO-\xb7OH measured in aqueous suspensions of the BC20 composite samples and DMPO-\xb7O2 E^{-} measured in methanol suspensions. The characteristic peaks of \xb7OH and \xb7O2 E^{-} radicals were all detected in BC20 composite samples under xenon lamp irradiation. The CB position of CdS is more negative than the redox potential of O2/\xb7O2 E^{-} (-0.33 eV vs RHE ). Therefore, it can provide electrons to produce \xb7O2 E^{-}. However, the VB position of CdS is more negative than the oxidation potential of \xb7OH/OHE^{-} (1.90 eV vs. RHE ), which prevents it from oxidizing OHE^{-} to \xb7OH. On the contrary, in contrast, the VB and CB positions of BFO are more positive than \xb7OH/OHE^{-} and O2/\xb7O2 E^{-}, which ensures its ability to oxidize OHE^{-} to \xb7OH but without \xb7O2 E^{-}. Based on the above analysis, if the heterojunction of BFO/CdS is type-II, it is unable to produce \xb7OH or \xb7O2 E^{-} radicals. The Z-scheme heterojunction composed of BFO/CdS retains the more reducing CB of CdS and the more oxidizing VB of BFO are retained to obtain a more effective redox capacity. To further explore the piezoelectricity of the pristine BFO, pristine CdS and heterojunction composites more intuitively, the piezoelectric coefficient (d33), piezoelectric current and piezoelectric voltage of each sample are shown in. The piezoelectric coefficients d33 of pristine BFO, CdS and composite samples with different ratios were measured to be 17.04, 20.24, 26.48, 35.2 and 29.5 pC\xb7NE^{\u22121}, respectively, by the preparation of thin films for each sample. In the stressed state, the top and bottom surfaces of the catalyst films have different potentials and the potential difference was measured to be 0.15, 0.21, 0.32, 0.51, and 0.39 V for BFO, CdS and each of the heterojunction composites, respectively (b). The measured output currents are shown in c, with 0.031, 0.039, 0.056, 0.078 and 0.125 \xb5A for each catalyst sample under cyclic compression. It is evident that both BFO/CdS heterojunction composites exhibit higher piezoelectric generation performance than pristine BFO or CdS. As the center displacements of negative and positive ions (bound charges) in the single-phase crystal are lower than the Curie temperature, the spontaneous polarisation induced by external forces results in an internal electrostatic field within the BFO and CdS domains, which leads to the directional separation of free charges and photogenerated carriers in the catalysts with a piezoelectric response. In order to further investigate the electron transfer pathways between the two components of BFO/CdS composites with different energy bands interleaved, the work function of the samples was calculated using density flood theory (DFT). The formula is expressed as W= Evac-EF, where Evac denotes the vacuum energy level of the material and EF denotes the Fermi energy level of the material. As shown in a and b, the work functions of BFO and CdS are 2.67 and 4.65 eV, respectively, and thus the Fermi energy level of BFO is higher than that of CdS. When the two single-phase materials contact at the interface to form a heterojunction, the electrons will be transferred from BFO to CdS. At the same time, a internal electric field is formed from the surface of CdS to the surface of BFO. Until the Fermi energy level reaches the equilibrium value, the work function of the BFO/CdS composite is 4.23 eV, which results in the formation of a Z-scheme charge transfer pathway, as shown in c. The formation of Z-Scheme heterojunctions was confirmed by band structure testing and ESR spectroscopy, combined with the electron flow direction confirmed in TEM. The charge transfer schematic of the BFO/CdS heterojunction composite is shown in. Since the EF of CdS is higher than that of BFO, and thus when CdS is in contact with BFO, electrons spontaneously migrate from the CdS surface to the BFO surface, leading to a new EF equilibrium. On the contrary, due to the inflow of electrons, negative charges accumulate at the interface of the BFO, resulting in downward bending of the energy bands Meanwhile, the redistribution of charges at the CdS/BFO interface generates an inbuilt electric field, which facilitates the binding of electrons in the CB of the BFO and holes in the VB of the CdS. Under visible light irradiation, the electrons in the CB of BFO were driven by the internal electric field to complex with the holes in the VB of CdS. Since BFO and CdS are not only photocatalysts but also proved to have excellent piezoelectric response, there is both an interfacial electric field formed by the Z-Scheme heterojunction and a polarisation electric field between the two components. When light and external stress act simultaneously on single components of BFO or CdS catalysts, the piezoelectric potential as a strong driving force can promote the separation of photogenerated carriers from free charges within the bulk phase in piezoelectric photocatalysts. Consequently, the photogenerated electrons in the BFO CB are rapidly transferred through the contact interface, and furthermore, the hydrogen generation reaction is accelerated due to the enhancement of the ferroelectric polarisation of the CdS and the BFO which makes the CB of the CdS sufficiently charged with electrons.

Piezoelectric polarization-induced photogenerated carriers transfer coupled with active electron transport Z-scheme heterojunction synergistic optimization of BiFeO<inf>3</inf>/CdS composite photocatalysts for hydrogen production

# ABSTRACT
In this study, Z-scheme heterostructures with active electron transport properties are constructed with multiferroic BiFeO3 and favorable visible light-responsive CdS nanosheets. The combination of BiFeO3 particles and ultrathin CdS not only suppresses the agglomeration of CdS nanosheets, but also assists in enhancing the specific surface area of the reaction system. The piezoelectric effect possessed by BiFeO3 and CdS leads to the triggering of spontaneous polarisation moments in response to external forces. The hydrogen evolution rate of the composite containing 20 wt% CdS reaches 3.58 mmol·g−1·h−1 under photo-piezoelectric coupling conditions, which is 116.64 fold higher than that of the pristine BiFeO3 under visible light irradiation.

# INTRODUCTION
About 90 % of the photogenerated carriers generated in photocatalytic materials after photoexcitation are rapidly complexed. When a certain wavelength range of light is absorbed by the catalyst, the semiconductor catalyst is excited by light and the electrons migrate from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB) of the catalyst, forming photogenerated electron-hole pairs. Huang et al. have linked the introduction of transition metal cations to the deformation of SiO4 tetrahedra and the generation of polarization fields through the accumulation of SiO4 tetrahedra in Ag6Si2O7. Theoretical calculations show that the photogenerated electron migration from Ag(c)O4 to Ag(b)O3 and then to Ag(a)O2 is consistent with the direction of the internally polarized electric field generated by the polar SiO4 tetrahedral arrangement. Ding et al. surface-modified polymerized carbon nitride (g-C3N4) with a graphite carbon ring to establish an internal electric field that caused light-induced eE^{-} and hE^{+} to move in different directions, thereby increasing the photocatalytic hydrogen production rate by 21 times. Liu et al. used the piezoelectric polarization of BiFeO3 in a core-shell structure to confine the photogenerated electrons and holes of TiO2 to the positive and negative sides of the piezoelectric, respectively. Heterojunction composites composed of semiconductor-semiconductor (S1-S2) are usually most common as type-I and type-II heterojunctions. Type-I heterojunctions consist of two- or multi-component semiconductors in which S2 has a higher CB than S1 and S2 has a lower VB than S1, thus holes and electrons are transferred and accumulate on S1. The photogenerated electron transfer from S2 to S1 in type-II heterojunctions depends on the CB of S2 in a more negative position. On the contrary, holes can migrate from S1 with more positive VB towards S2, resulting in spatial carriers separation and enhanced photocatalytic reactivity. Although the type-II heterojunction performs perfectly in charge separation, there are still some shortcomings. Because the transfer of electrons from higher to lowerenergy level and holes from lower to higher energy level makes the reacting system have a more positive CB and a more negative VB, in thermodynamics this charge transfer mechanism is detrimental to the redox capacity of the reacting system. In terms of energy utilisation, the CB or VB energy difference between S2 and S1 is not involved in the photocatalytic reaction. In relation to the decreasing redox capacity of type-II heterojunctions, Z-scheme heterojunctions have a more suitable charge transfer system for redox reactions. Photogenerated electrons in semiconductor S1 having a low reduction capacity are compounded with photogenerated holes in semiconductor S2 possessing reduced oxidation capacity. Consequently, it is possible to maintain photogenerated electrons in the semiconductor S2 possessing a high reduction capability and photogenerated holes in the semiconductor S1 with a high oxidation capability. It is also important to note that carrier mobilisation for Z-scheme photocatalysts is physiologically more viable than that for type-II heterojunction photocatalysts, since the photogenerated electrons migrating from the CB of the semiconductor S1 to the photogenerated holes VB of the semiconductor S2 are advantageous due to the electrostatic attraction between the electrons and the holes. A direct Z-scheme heterojunction formation between the CdS/WO3 composites prepared by Jin et al. improves carrier separation efficiency, which in turn exhibited a better photocatalytic methane production efficiency. Yu et al. constructed an interfacial linker coordinated heterostructured cadmium sulfide/zirconium-based metal-organic framework (CdS/NU-M) to realize a Z-scheme charge transfer channel in CdS/NU-M. As the photogenerated charges were efficiently separated and transported to the surface, it induced a 10 times higher photocatalytic hydrogen production rate of CdS/NU-M than that of the pure phase photocatalyst. Wu et al. constructed a Z-scheme BiFeO3/Bi2O4 heterostructure by anchoring BiFeO3 nanoparticles to Bi2O4 with a rod structure, and elucidated the charge transfer pathway between BiFeO3 and Bi2O4 based on the band structure and the main active substances. Therefore, the typical piezoelectric photocatalysts CdS and BiFeO3 are used as the research objects in this paper, and the Z-scheme heterojunction composites of BiFeO3 coated with ultrathin CdS are successfully prepared.

# CONCLUSION
In this thesis, BFO/CdS heterojunction composite catalysts are constructed based mainly on the perovskite oxide BFO, and the multiferroic nature of the BFO-based materials is optimised by constructing it with CdS nanosheets. The constructed Z-Scheme heterojunction reduces the recombination of photogenerated carriers and enhances the interfacial charge transportation as well as the adsorption and desorption rates of the reaction medium, as corroborated by band structure calculations, PL spectroscopy, radical trapping experiments, and catalytic hydrogen production performance. In this case, the visible light catalysis hydrogen production rate of BC20 reached 1.31 mmol\xb7gE^{\u22121}\xb7hE^{\u22121}, which is 42.81 times higher than that of the pristine BFO. Further, it is verified that both BFO and CdS have not only a visible light response but also favorable piezoelectricity. It is further revealed that photogenerated electrons and holes are more prone to migrate in the direction of the piezoelectric polarisation field strength of BFO/CdS induction. Meanwhile, the retained more negative CB of CdS and the more positive VB of BFO further optimised the redox capacity of the composite catalysts. The experimental results show that the BC20 composite achieves a hydrogen production rate of 3.58 mmol\xb7gE^{\u22121}\xb7hE^{\u22121} by photo-piezoelectric catalysis in a sacrificial agent environment, and also possesses the ability to deionised water splitting.
