# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
We calculated the monolayer structures of Y2COX (X = O, S, Se) using first-principles methods, as shown in. In the top-down view of the xy-plane, the dashed box outlines the primitive unit cell of the Y2COX crystal structure, with each primitive unit containing 5 atoms. The directions of the crystallographic axes are denoted by a and b, and a\u2080 denotes the lattice constant. In Fig. 1(a)\u2013(c), a\u2080 is 7.43 \xc5, 3.83 \xc5, and 3.82 \xc5, respectively. From the top-down view of the xy-plane, the overall Y\u2082COX lattice structure exhibits a honeycomb pattern, which is composed of transition metal Y atoms. The vertical distances between the topmost O atoms and the middle C atoms (h 1) and between the bottom X atoms and the middle C atoms (h 2) are shown in , where h 1is smaller than h 2 for all three structures. By comparing the values of h 1 and h 2 in Fig. 1(a)\u2013(c), we observe significant differences in h 1 and h 2 for Figure 1(b) and 1(c). This indicates that the atomic radii of S and Se in the Y2COS and Y2COSe structures are considerably larger than that of O, leading to the pronounced differences in h\u2081 and h\u2082. In this study, we only investigate er MXenes, without considering interactions between adjacent layers. To investigate the stability of the Y2COX monolayer, we calculated the phonon dispersion spectra and AIMD spectra of the Y\u2082COX monolayer, as shown in the figure. The phonon spectra in (a)-(c) indicate that the three red curves with zero frequency at the high-symmetry point \u0393 represent the acoustic branches, while the black curves with non-zero frequencies correspond to the optical branches. The absence of imaginary vibrational frequencies in the acoustic branches near the high-symmetry points (\u0393, M, K) demonstrates that Y2COX MXenes can exist stably from a dynamical perspective. From the phonon density of states (PHDOS) spectra, it is evident that the phonon states of the heavier atoms are primarily concentrated in the low-frequency region, whereas those of the lighter atoms are mainly found in the high-frequency region. Additionally, we performed AIMD simulations using a 3 \xd7 3 \xd7 1 supercell to analyse the energy fluctuations of each atom at room temperature (300 K) for Y2COX (X = O, S, Se) under NVT ensemble conditions over 2000 steps (with a timestep of 3 fs), as shown in (d)-(f). This confirms that Y2COX (X = O, S, Se) maintains thermal stability at room temperature. We also calculated the phonon spectra of Y2CSO and Y2CSeO, and the results show significant imaginary frequencies in their phonon spectra, proving that the Y2CSO and Y2CSeO structures are unstable (see Figure S1). To assess the thermodynamic stability of Y2COX materials, we calculated their formation energies using the following formula : where \u03b5 is the total energy of the Y2COX monolayer, \u03b51, \u03b52, \u03b53 , and \u03b54 are the crystal energies per atom of Y, C, O, and X in Y2COX, respectively, a, b, c, and d denote the number of atoms for each element in the unit cell, and N (N = a + b + c + d) is the total number of atoms. Through calculations, we obtained negative formation energies for Y2CO2, Y2COS, and Y2COSe, as shown in , proving their thermodynamic stability. To prevent leakage currents during polarization, we performed calculations of the electronic band structure and density of states (DOS) to thoroughly investigate the electronic properties of Y2CO2, Y2COS, and Y2COSe. Notably, while Y2CO2 behaves as an indirect bandgap semiconductor, Y2COS and Y2COSe are direct bandgap semiconductors, demonstrating their significant potential in the field of piezoelectric materials. To obtain more accurate and reliable results for the band structure calculations, we employed a combination of PBE and HSE06 methods to compute the bandgaps. By comparing (a)-(c), we can clearly observe the changes in bandgaps for Y2CO2, Y2COS, and Y2COSe under PBE and HSE06 computational levels. The bandgaps at the PBE level are 1.25 eV, 1.07 eV, and 0.65 eV, respectively, showing a decreasing trend from Y2CO2 to Y2COSe. At the HSE06 level, the bandgaps are 2.26 eV, 2.06 eV, and 1.51 eV, which are larger in magnitude compared to the PBE results, although the relative trend remains unchanged. The smaller bandgaps of Y2COS and Y2COSe compared to Y2CO2 indicate that substituting O atoms with S or Se atoms not only alters the type of bandgap but also effectively reduces the width of the bandgap. Consequently, valence band electrons require a relatively wider bandgap to transition into the conduction band, which explains why Y2COS has a wider bandgap than Y2COSe. Near the Fermi level, the conduction band and valence band of Y2COX are primarily contributed by the d orbitals of the Y atoms and the p orbitals of the C, O, and X (X = O, S, Se) atoms, as shown in Figure S2. (d)-(f) present the COHP (Crystal Orbital Hamilton Population) spectra for the Y-X and show that MXenes such as M2C and M2CO2 have been experimentally synthesized. Therefore, in this study, we focused solely on the COHP of Y-X (X = O, S, Se) atoms. We found that the Fermi levels of all three MXenes lie within the bonding state region, with no or only minimal antibonding state regions below the Fermi level (\u03b5F). Furthermore, considering that Y is a heavy element, the electronic band structures of these three materials were calculated using the PBE functional with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) to enhance their accuracy. As shown in (a)-(c), SOC breaks the spin degeneracy and induces valley spin splitting at the high-symmetry K points in the conduction band due to the presence of an electric dipole moment. We found that the valence bands exhibit significant spin splitting along the M-K and K-\u0393 directions, while the bands along the \u0393-M direction show smaller spin splitting. In the Y2COX (X = O, S, Se) structure, the symmetry breaking leads to an in-plane average electrostatic potential difference in the Y2COX monolayer. The work function, which gives the minimum energy required for electrons to escape from the surface, can be expressed by the formula \u03a6 = E-E F, where \u03a6 is the work function, E is the vacuum energy level in the stationary state, and E F is the Fermi level, as shown in. For the Y2COS monolayer structure, the work functions of the bottom S atom and the top O atom are 6.46 eV and 2.40 eV, respectively, resulting in a plane-averaged electrostatic potential difference of 4.06 eV in the vertical direction. Similarly, the Y2CO2 and Y2COSe monolayer structures also generate electrostatic potential differences of 1.65 eV and 4.10 eV, respectively, which causes the three monolayer structures to exhibit a significant vertical built-in electric field (E int). According to the formula E int = \u0394\u03a6/eh (where e is the charge of the electron and h is the thickness of the monolayer structure), the intensities of the built-in electric field for Y2CO2, Y2COS, and Y2COSe are 0.41 eV/\xc5, 0.87 eV/\xc5, and 0.84 eV/\xc5, respectively. The Y2COS monolayer has the largest built-in electric field, indicating the strongest vertical polarization. The larger built-in electric field in the Y2COS monolayer results in a stronger vertical polarization, providing a larger d 33 to enhance the out-of-plane piezoelectricity. We calculated the differential charge density so as to understand the charge distribution in Y2COX materials further. The differential charge density is commonly used to describe charge distributions: it gives the difference between the charge density of a Y2COX material and the sum of the individual atomic charge densities. It is expressed as \u0394\u03c1 ( r\u2192)=\u03c1 [ Y2COX]\u2212 \u2211\u03bc \u03c1 atom ( r\u2192\u2212 R \u03bc\u2192). We also performed Bader charge analyses on the Y2COX monolayers. The three-dimensional differential charge density isosurface level is set at 0.01 e/\xc5\xb3. The maximum total electron transfer for the three materials is approximately 3.43|e|. We also calculated the ratio of electron gain for O, C, and X atoms in the three materials as 1:0.67:0.8, 1:0.93:0.75, and 1:0.72:0.52, respectively. When X is O, h 1 and h 2 in the Y2CO2 structure are relatively close to those of Y2COS and Y2COSe. The values of h 1 and h 2 are shown in. When X is S or Se, the difference between h 1 and h 2 in the Y2COS and Y2COSe structures is larger than for Y2CO2. Therefore, Y2COS and Y2COSe may exhibit greater piezoelectric performance in the vertical direction than Y2CO2. However, the h 1 and h 2 in Y2COS and Y2COSe are relatively close, and the S atoms gain more electrons than the Se atoms. Consequently, Y2COS may exhibit greater piezoelectric performance in the vertical direction than Y2COSe. To achieve high-efficiency electromechanical conversion in Y2COX, the key lies in satisfying the requirements of plastic deformation under applied stress. According to the Born\u2212Huang criteria, the elastic stiffness coefficients of Y2COX must satisfy the equations C 11 C 22-C 122 > 0 and C 66 > 0, indicating that Y2COX possesses good mechanical properties. The elastic stiffness coefficients of Y2COX are shown in. The formulas for Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio are where A=(C 11 C 22-C 122)/C 66-2C 12, B=C 11+C 22-(C 11 C 22-C 122/C 66, C 11 =C 22, and \u03b8 is an arbitrary angle related to the X-axis. Using formulas (2) and (3), we calculated Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio for Y2CO2, Y2COS, and Y2COSe. As shown in , the results of these calculations demonstrate the strong isotropic characteristics of the Y2COX system in terms of mechanical properties. When the angle \u03b8 is 0\xb0 or 90\xb0, the Young's modulus of Y2CO2, Y2COS, and Y2COSe are 99.53, 72.32, and 70.72 N/m, respectively, while their Poisson's ratios are 0.55, 0.52, and 0.52, respectively. It is noteworthy that when S and Se atoms replace O atoms, the Young's modulus of Y2COX shows a decreasing trend, while Poisson's ratio increases. This implies that Y2COS and Y2COSe are structurally more flexible than Y2CO2 and other materials. For example, compared to monolayer Sc2CO2 (Young's modulus of 120 N/m) and penta-CNP (minimum Young's modulus of 172 N/m) , the lower Young's modulus of Y2COS and Y2COSe makes them more advantageous in fields such as flexible electronic devices and wearable equipment that require a certain degree of flexibility. To accurately investigate the piezoelectric properties of Y2COX materials, we used the density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) method to calculate the piezoelectric stress coefficients (eijk ) and the finite element method to determine the elastic stiffness coefficients (Ckl ). The piezoelectric strain coefficients (dijk) can be derived from their relations with the piezoelectric stress coefficients (eijk ):  Here, \u03b5jk, \u03c3jk, Pi , and Ei denote the strain tensor, stress tensor, polarization vector, and macroscopic electric field, respectively, with i, j, and k referring to the x, y, and z directions. According to the Voigt notation, we simplify the expressions of these coefficients, allowing the abbreviation of dijk and eijk as dil and eil , where l stands for xx (1), yy (2), zz (3), yz (4), zx (5) and xy (6). Therefore, based on the Voigt notation, the direct relations between the elastic stiffness coefficients, stress piezoelectric coefficients, and strain piezoelectric coefficients are as follows: where the elastic stiffness matrix  The piezoelectric strain coefficient matrix is  Thus, through matrix operations, we obtain the three strain piezoelectric coefficients of interest: d22, d31, and d33, with their specific expressions as  The results of the calculations are shown in , where e 21 = -e 22 and e 31 = e 32. It is evident that for the three materials Y2CO2, Y2COS, and Y2COSe, the absence of a centre of inversion symmetry leads to both the in-plane piezoelectric stress coefficient e 21 and the out-of-plane piezoelectric stress coefficient e 31 being non-zero. Additionally, the out-of-plane piezoelectric stress coefficients e 33 for the Y2COS and Y2COSe structures are greater than that of the Y2CO2 structure. Notably, the Y2COS structure exhibits a remarkably large out-of-plane piezoelectric strain coefficient d 33 = \u2212398.49 pm/V, d 31 = 0.22pm/V, and an in-plane piezoelectric strain coefficient d 22= \u221212.2 pm/V. Similarly, the Y2COSe structure demonstrates relatively impressive piezoelectric coefficients (d 33 = \u2212311.76 pm/V, d 31 = 0.15 pm/V, d 22 = \u221215.01 pm/V). The reason for these results is that the Young's moduli of Y2COS and Y2COSe are significantly lower than that of Y2CO2, resulting in better flexibility for Y2COS and Y2COSe materials. For example, the MXenes Sc2COS (d 33 = 54.47 pm/V) and Sc2COSe (d 33 = 75.88 pm/V) , Janus \u03b3-GeSnSO (d 33 = 4.29 pm/V) and \u03b3-GeSnSeO (d 33 = 2.80 pm/V) , and Janus CrBr1.5I1.5 (d 22 = 0.557 pm/V). Additionally, compared to some experimentally synthesized materials, they also exhibit superior out-of-plane piezoelectric coefficients, such as CdS thin films (d 33 = 32.8 pm/V) , 3R-MoS2 flakes (d 33 = 0.9 pm/V) , and (BiFeO3)0.7(PbTiO3)0.3 ceramics (d 33 = 160 pm/V) , among others. Finally, it is noteworthy that d 33 is one to three orders of magnitude higher than d 22 or d 31. In the figure, the cyan area indicates Y2CO2, the yellow area indicates Y2COS, and the green area indicates Y2COSe. The electronegativity for each element in these materials are Y (1.22), C (2.55), O (3.44), S (2.58), and Se (2.55). Here, we introduced an R atom to replace the Y-C atomic layer, and the relative electronegativity value of the R atom, R eln, can be expressed as   Therefore, the electronegativity difference ratio (red) for Y2COX monolayers can be obtained using the following formula:  It was observed that for Y2COX (X = O, S, Se), as X changes from O to S to Se, |d33 | first increases and then decreases, while |e33 | shows a progressive increase. Due to the small difference in electronegativity between S and Se atoms, the |d33 | and |e33 | of Y2COS and Y2COSe are relatively close compared to those of Y2CO2.

# TITLE
Large out-of-plane piezoelectricity in MXene Y<inf>2</inf>COX (X = O, S, Se) monolayers

# ABSTRACT
Through the ongoing exploration of two-dimensional materials, MXene thin films have gradually emerged as outstanding candidates for piezoelectric applications, due to their excellent electrical conductivity, large specific surface area, tunable bandgap, and remarkable flexibility. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we thoroughly investigate the effects of oxygen, sulfur, and selenium on the piezoelectric properties of Y2COX (X = O, S, Se) MXene monolayers. Our results demonstrate that Y2COX MXene monolayers exhibit good stability in terms of their thermodynamics, kinetics, and mechanical properties, while also possessing large out-of-plane piezoelectric coefficients. Specifically, the out-of-plane strain piezoelectric coefficients d
                     33 of Y2COS and Y2COSe reach −398.49 pm/V and −311.76 pm/V, respectively. Moreover, the d₃₃ coefficients are 1 to 3 orders of magnitude higher than d
                     22 or d

# INTRODUCTION
For example, Janus monolayers such as MoXSiN2 (X = S, Se, Te) and BMX 2 (M = Ga, In and X = S, Se) generate piezoelectric effects due to their broken structural symmetry. MXene materials with Janus structures are also a class of two-dimensional transition metal carbides or nitrides that exhibit piezoelectric properties due to the breaking of a structural symmetry. Their general chemical formula is Mn+1X\u2099Tx (where M = Ti, Sc, Y, Nb, etc.; X = C, N; T = -O, -OH, -F, -S, etc.) , with n ranging from 1 to 3, and x denoting the number of terminal functional groups T. Examples of MXenes include Ti2C, Sc2CO2, and Sc2CS2. Since their introduction, MXenes have quickly garnered widespread attention in fields such as functional materials, energy storage, and biomedicine, owing to their excellent electrical  and optical  properties, as well as their abundant surface functional groups. Whether MXenes also possess outstanding piezoelectric coefficients is, then, worth exploring. Numerous studies have indicated that MXenes exhibit high electrical conductivity, large specific surface areas, good toughness, and tunable band gaps, all of which contribute to their tremendous potential in the piezoelectric product sector. According to reports, M 2CO2 MXene materials exhibit semiconducting behaviour and inversion asymmetry, demonstrating significant polarization and piezoelectric responses in both the in-plane and out-of-plane directions. Specifically, oxygen-functionalized MXene (i.e. M 2CO2, where M = Sc, Y, La) thin films have been confirmed to possess piezoelectric voltage characteristics. Density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) calculations indicate that M 2CO2 MXene materials have high elastic coefficients and Poisson's ratios, showcasing excellent mechanical properties. Notably, the piezoelectric stress coefficient e 11 of Y2CO2 reaches as high as \u2212394.49 pm/V, significantly higher than that of Sc2CO2(\u2212285 pm/V). Conversely, Sc2CO2exhibits a higher out-of-plane piezoelectric stress coefficient e 31 (\u2212196 pm/V) compared to Y2CO2 (\u221288 pm/V). To further enhance the out-of-plane piezoelectric coefficient of Y2CO2, we used density functional perturbation theory to simulate thin films of MXenes Y2COX (X = O, S, Se) and successfully predicted their mechanical and piezoelectric properties. Previously, MXenes with surface terminations such as O, Cl, S, Se, and Br were successfully synthesized through substitution and elimination reactions in molten inorganic salts, and these MXenes exhibited unique properties. Inspired by these findings, we selected O, S, and Se as the lower surface termination elements for Y2CO. The non-centrosymmetric adsorption of different atoms on the top and bottom surfaces of Y2C breaks the inversion symmetry of M2C. Through further theoretical calculations, we confirmed that MXene Y2COX materials not only exhibit semiconducting behaviour but also demonstrate high mechanical stability. Due to their semiconducting behaviour and inversion asymmetry, MXene Y2COX materials display substantial out-of-plane piezoelectric properties. With their high mechanical stability and significant out-of-plane piezoelectric coefficients, MXene Y2COX materials show great promise for applications in wearable devices and energy harvesting modules. These discoveries not only provide new insights into the study of MXenes but also open up new possibilities for the development of future functional materials.

# CONCLUSION
We successfully predicted and verified that the Y2COX (Y2CO2, Y2COS, Y2COSe) monolayer structures exhibit outstanding piezoelectric performance in both the in-plane and out-of-plane directions. Calculations of the phonon spectra, AIMD diagrams, formation energies, COPH spectra, as well as Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio, demonstrate that this material not only possesses excellent dynamical, thermodynamic, and chemical bond stability but also exhibits good mechanical properties, making it an exceptionally flexible material. Among these three MXene monolayers, the Y2COS and Y2COSe monolayers have larger values of d 33 (\u2013398.49 pm/V and \u2013311.76 pm/V) due to their superior flexibility (Young's moduli of 72.32 N/m and 70.72 N/m and Poisson's ratios of 0.52 and 0.52)and strong average planar electrostatic potential differences (\u0394\u03a6 = 4.06 eV and 4.10 eV), and their d\u2083\u2083 piezoelectric coefficients are 1 to 3 orders of magnitude higher than d 22 or d 31. We found that the out-of-plane piezoelectric stress coefficient |e 33| increases as the difference in electronegativity decreases. These excellent properties grant Y2COS and Y2COSe monolayer films tremendous potential and prospects in applications such as energy harvesting modules and wearable devices.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
We calculated the monolayer structures of Y2COX (X = O, S, Se) using first-principles methods, as shown in. In the top-down view of the xy-plane, the dashed box outlines the primitive unit cell of the Y2COX crystal structure, with each primitive unit containing 5 atoms. The directions of the crystallographic axes are denoted by a and b, and a\u2080 denotes the lattice constant. In Fig. 1(a)\u2013(c), a\u2080 is 7.43 \xc5, 3.83 \xc5, and 3.82 \xc5, respectively. From the top-down view of the xy-plane, the overall Y\u2082COX lattice structure exhibits a honeycomb pattern, which is composed of transition metal Y atoms. The vertical distances between the topmost O atoms and the middle C atoms (h 1) and between the bottom X atoms and the middle C atoms (h 2) are shown in , where h 1is smaller than h 2 for all three structures. By comparing the values of h 1 and h 2 in Fig. 1(a)\u2013(c), we observe significant differences in h 1 and h 2 for Figure 1(b) and 1(c). This indicates that the atomic radii of S and Se in the Y2COS and Y2COSe structures are considerably larger than that of O, leading to the pronounced differences in h\u2081 and h\u2082. In this study, we only investigate er MXenes, without considering interactions between adjacent layers. To investigate the stability of the Y2COX monolayer, we calculated the phonon dispersion spectra and AIMD spectra of the Y\u2082COX monolayer, as shown in the figure. The phonon spectra in (a)-(c) indicate that the three red curves with zero frequency at the high-symmetry point \u0393 represent the acoustic branches, while the black curves with non-zero frequencies correspond to the optical branches. The absence of imaginary vibrational frequencies in the acoustic branches near the high-symmetry points (\u0393, M, K) demonstrates that Y2COX MXenes can exist stably from a dynamical perspective. From the phonon density of states (PHDOS) spectra, it is evident that the phonon states of the heavier atoms are primarily concentrated in the low-frequency region, whereas those of the lighter atoms are mainly found in the high-frequency region. Additionally, we performed AIMD simulations using a 3 \xd7 3 \xd7 1 supercell to analyse the energy fluctuations of each atom at room temperature (300 K) for Y2COX (X = O, S, Se) under NVT ensemble conditions over 2000 steps (with a timestep of 3 fs), as shown in (d)-(f). This confirms that Y2COX (X = O, S, Se) maintains thermal stability at room temperature. We also calculated the phonon spectra of Y2CSO and Y2CSeO, and the results show significant imaginary frequencies in their phonon spectra, proving that the Y2CSO and Y2CSeO structures are unstable (see Figure S1). To assess the thermodynamic stability of Y2COX materials, we calculated their formation energies using the following formula : where \u03b5 is the total energy of the Y2COX monolayer, \u03b51, \u03b52, \u03b53 , and \u03b54 are the crystal energies per atom of Y, C, O, and X in Y2COX, respectively, a, b, c, and d denote the number of atoms for each element in the unit cell, and N (N = a + b + c + d) is the total number of atoms. Through calculations, we obtained negative formation energies for Y2CO2, Y2COS, and Y2COSe, as shown in , proving their thermodynamic stability. To prevent leakage currents during polarization, we performed calculations of the electronic band structure and density of states (DOS) to thoroughly investigate the electronic properties of Y2CO2, Y2COS, and Y2COSe. Notably, while Y2CO2 behaves as an indirect bandgap semiconductor, Y2COS and Y2COSe are direct bandgap semiconductors, demonstrating their significant potential in the field of piezoelectric materials. To obtain more accurate and reliable results for the band structure calculations, we employed a combination of PBE and HSE06 methods to compute the bandgaps. By comparing (a)-(c), we can clearly observe the changes in bandgaps for Y2CO2, Y2COS, and Y2COSe under PBE and HSE06 computational levels. The bandgaps at the PBE level are 1.25 eV, 1.07 eV, and 0.65 eV, respectively, showing a decreasing trend from Y2CO2 to Y2COSe. At the HSE06 level, the bandgaps are 2.26 eV, 2.06 eV, and 1.51 eV, which are larger in magnitude compared to the PBE results, although the relative trend remains unchanged. The smaller bandgaps of Y2COS and Y2COSe compared to Y2CO2 indicate that substituting O atoms with S or Se atoms not only alters the type of bandgap but also effectively reduces the width of the bandgap. Consequently, valence band electrons require a relatively wider bandgap to transition into the conduction band, which explains why Y2COS has a wider bandgap than Y2COSe. Near the Fermi level, the conduction band and valence band of Y2COX are primarily contributed by the d orbitals of the Y atoms and the p orbitals of the C, O, and X (X = O, S, Se) atoms, as shown in Figure S2. (d)-(f) present the COHP (Crystal Orbital Hamilton Population) spectra for the Y-X and show that MXenes such as M2C and M2CO2 have been experimentally synthesized. Therefore, in this study, we focused solely on the COHP of Y-X (X = O, S, Se) atoms. We found that the Fermi levels of all three MXenes lie within the bonding state region, with no or only minimal antibonding state regions below the Fermi level (\u03b5F). Furthermore, considering that Y is a heavy element, the electronic band structures of these three materials were calculated using the PBE functional with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) to enhance their accuracy. As shown in (a)-(c), SOC breaks the spin degeneracy and induces valley spin splitting at the high-symmetry K points in the conduction band due to the presence of an electric dipole moment. We found that the valence bands exhibit significant spin splitting along the M-K and K-\u0393 directions, while the bands along the \u0393-M direction show smaller spin splitting. In the Y2COX (X = O, S, Se) structure, the symmetry breaking leads to an in-plane average electrostatic potential difference in the Y2COX monolayer. The work function, which gives the minimum energy required for electrons to escape from the surface, can be expressed by the formula \u03a6 = E-E F, where \u03a6 is the work function, E is the vacuum energy level in the stationary state, and E F is the Fermi level, as shown in. For the Y2COS monolayer structure, the work functions of the bottom S atom and the top O atom are 6.46 eV and 2.40 eV, respectively, resulting in a plane-averaged electrostatic potential difference of 4.06 eV in the vertical direction. Similarly, the Y2CO2 and Y2COSe monolayer structures also generate electrostatic potential differences of 1.65 eV and 4.10 eV, respectively, which causes the three monolayer structures to exhibit a significant vertical built-in electric field (E int). According to the formula E int = \u0394\u03a6/eh (where e is the charge of the electron and h is the thickness of the monolayer structure), the intensities of the built-in electric field for Y2CO2, Y2COS, and Y2COSe are 0.41 eV/\xc5, 0.87 eV/\xc5, and 0.84 eV/\xc5, respectively. The Y2COS monolayer has the largest built-in electric field, indicating the strongest vertical polarization. The larger built-in electric field in the Y2COS monolayer results in a stronger vertical polarization, providing a larger d 33 to enhance the out-of-plane piezoelectricity. We calculated the differential charge density so as to understand the charge distribution in Y2COX materials further. The differential charge density is commonly used to describe charge distributions: it gives the difference between the charge density of a Y2COX material and the sum of the individual atomic charge densities. It is expressed as \u0394\u03c1 ( r\u2192)=\u03c1 [ Y2COX]\u2212 \u2211\u03bc \u03c1 atom ( r\u2192\u2212 R \u03bc\u2192). We also performed Bader charge analyses on the Y2COX monolayers. The three-dimensional differential charge density isosurface level is set at 0.01 e/\xc5\xb3. The maximum total electron transfer for the three materials is approximately 3.43|e|. We also calculated the ratio of electron gain for O, C, and X atoms in the three materials as 1:0.67:0.8, 1:0.93:0.75, and 1:0.72:0.52, respectively. When X is O, h 1 and h 2 in the Y2CO2 structure are relatively close to those of Y2COS and Y2COSe. The values of h 1 and h 2 are shown in. When X is S or Se, the difference between h 1 and h 2 in the Y2COS and Y2COSe structures is larger than for Y2CO2. Therefore, Y2COS and Y2COSe may exhibit greater piezoelectric performance in the vertical direction than Y2CO2. However, the h 1 and h 2 in Y2COS and Y2COSe are relatively close, and the S atoms gain more electrons than the Se atoms. Consequently, Y2COS may exhibit greater piezoelectric performance in the vertical direction than Y2COSe. To achieve high-efficiency electromechanical conversion in Y2COX, the key lies in satisfying the requirements of plastic deformation under applied stress. According to the Born\u2212Huang criteria, the elastic stiffness coefficients of Y2COX must satisfy the equations C 11 C 22-C 122 > 0 and C 66 > 0, indicating that Y2COX possesses good mechanical properties. The elastic stiffness coefficients of Y2COX are shown in. The formulas for Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio are where A=(C 11 C 22-C 122)/C 66-2C 12, B=C 11+C 22-(C 11 C 22-C 122/C 66, C 11 =C 22, and \u03b8 is an arbitrary angle related to the X-axis. Using formulas (2) and (3), we calculated Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio for Y2CO2, Y2COS, and Y2COSe. As shown in , the results of these calculations demonstrate the strong isotropic characteristics of the Y2COX system in terms of mechanical properties. When the angle \u03b8 is 0\xb0 or 90\xb0, the Young's modulus of Y2CO2, Y2COS, and Y2COSe are 99.53, 72.32, and 70.72 N/m, respectively, while their Poisson's ratios are 0.55, 0.52, and 0.52, respectively. It is noteworthy that when S and Se atoms replace O atoms, the Young's modulus of Y2COX shows a decreasing trend, while Poisson's ratio increases. This implies that Y2COS and Y2COSe are structurally more flexible than Y2CO2 and other materials. For example, compared to monolayer Sc2CO2 (Young's modulus of 120 N/m) and penta-CNP (minimum Young's modulus of 172 N/m) , the lower Young's modulus of Y2COS and Y2COSe makes them more advantageous in fields such as flexible electronic devices and wearable equipment that require a certain degree of flexibility. To accurately investigate the piezoelectric properties of Y2COX materials, we used the density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) method to calculate the piezoelectric stress coefficients (eijk ) and the finite element method to determine the elastic stiffness coefficients (Ckl ). The piezoelectric strain coefficients (dijk) can be derived from their relations with the piezoelectric stress coefficients (eijk ):  Here, \u03b5jk, \u03c3jk, Pi , and Ei denote the strain tensor, stress tensor, polarization vector, and macroscopic electric field, respectively, with i, j, and k referring to the x, y, and z directions. According to the Voigt notation, we simplify the expressions of these coefficients, allowing the abbreviation of dijk and eijk as dil and eil , where l stands for xx (1), yy (2), zz (3), yz (4), zx (5) and xy (6). Therefore, based on the Voigt notation, the direct relations between the elastic stiffness coefficients, stress piezoelectric coefficients, and strain piezoelectric coefficients are as follows: where the elastic stiffness matrix  The piezoelectric strain coefficient matrix is  Thus, through matrix operations, we obtain the three strain piezoelectric coefficients of interest: d22, d31, and d33, with their specific expressions as  The results of the calculations are shown in , where e 21 = -e 22 and e 31 = e 32. It is evident that for the three materials Y2CO2, Y2COS, and Y2COSe, the absence of a centre of inversion symmetry leads to both the in-plane piezoelectric stress coefficient e 21 and the out-of-plane piezoelectric stress coefficient e 31 being non-zero. Additionally, the out-of-plane piezoelectric stress coefficients e 33 for the Y2COS and Y2COSe structures are greater than that of the Y2CO2 structure. Notably, the Y2COS structure exhibits a remarkably large out-of-plane piezoelectric strain coefficient d 33 = \u2212398.49 pm/V, d 31 = 0.22pm/V, and an in-plane piezoelectric strain coefficient d 22= \u221212.2 pm/V. Similarly, the Y2COSe structure demonstrates relatively impressive piezoelectric coefficients (d 33 = \u2212311.76 pm/V, d 31 = 0.15 pm/V, d 22 = \u221215.01 pm/V). The reason for these results is that the Young's moduli of Y2COS and Y2COSe are significantly lower than that of Y2CO2, resulting in better flexibility for Y2COS and Y2COSe materials. For example, the MXenes Sc2COS (d 33 = 54.47 pm/V) and Sc2COSe (d 33 = 75.88 pm/V) , Janus \u03b3-GeSnSO (d 33 = 4.29 pm/V) and \u03b3-GeSnSeO (d 33 = 2.80 pm/V) , and Janus CrBr1.5I1.5 (d 22 = 0.557 pm/V). Additionally, compared to some experimentally synthesized materials, they also exhibit superior out-of-plane piezoelectric coefficients, such as CdS thin films (d 33 = 32.8 pm/V) , 3R-MoS2 flakes (d 33 = 0.9 pm/V) , and (BiFeO3)0.7(PbTiO3)0.3 ceramics (d 33 = 160 pm/V) , among others. Finally, it is noteworthy that d 33 is one to three orders of magnitude higher than d 22 or d 31. In the figure, the cyan area indicates Y2CO2, the yellow area indicates Y2COS, and the green area indicates Y2COSe. The electronegativity for each element in these materials are Y (1.22), C (2.55), O (3.44), S (2.58), and Se (2.55). Here, we introduced an R atom to replace the Y-C atomic layer, and the relative electronegativity value of the R atom, R eln, can be expressed as   Therefore, the electronegativity difference ratio (red) for Y2COX monolayers can be obtained using the following formula:  It was observed that for Y2COX (X = O, S, Se), as X changes from O to S to Se, |d33 | first increases and then decreases, while |e33 | shows a progressive increase. Due to the small difference in electronegativity between S and Se atoms, the |d33 | and |e33 | of Y2COS and Y2COSe are relatively close compared to those of Y2CO2.

Large out-of-plane piezoelectricity in MXene Y<inf>2</inf>COX (X = O, S, Se) monolayers

# ABSTRACT
Through the ongoing exploration of two-dimensional materials, MXene thin films have gradually emerged as outstanding candidates for piezoelectric applications, due to their excellent electrical conductivity, large specific surface area, tunable bandgap, and remarkable flexibility. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we thoroughly investigate the effects of oxygen, sulfur, and selenium on the piezoelectric properties of Y2COX (X = O, S, Se) MXene monolayers. Our results demonstrate that Y2COX MXene monolayers exhibit good stability in terms of their thermodynamics, kinetics, and mechanical properties, while also possessing large out-of-plane piezoelectric coefficients. Specifically, the out-of-plane strain piezoelectric coefficients d

# INTRODUCTION
For example, Janus monolayers such as MoXSiN2 (X = S, Se, Te) and BMX 2 (M = Ga, In and X = S, Se) generate piezoelectric effects due to their broken structural symmetry. MXene materials with Janus structures are also a class of two-dimensional transition metal carbides or nitrides that exhibit piezoelectric properties due to the breaking of a structural symmetry. Their general chemical formula is Mn+1X\u2099Tx (where M = Ti, Sc, Y, Nb, etc.; X = C, N; T = -O, -OH, -F, -S, etc.) , with n ranging from 1 to 3, and x denoting the number of terminal functional groups T. Examples of MXenes include Ti2C, Sc2CO2, and Sc2CS2. Since their introduction, MXenes have quickly garnered widespread attention in fields such as functional materials, energy storage, and biomedicine, owing to their excellent electrical  and optical  properties, as well as their abundant surface functional groups. Whether MXenes also possess outstanding piezoelectric coefficients is, then, worth exploring. Numerous studies have indicated that MXenes exhibit high electrical conductivity, large specific surface areas, good toughness, and tunable band gaps, all of which contribute to their tremendous potential in the piezoelectric product sector. According to reports, M 2CO2 MXene materials exhibit semiconducting behaviour and inversion asymmetry, demonstrating significant polarization and piezoelectric responses in both the in-plane and out-of-plane directions. Specifically, oxygen-functionalized MXene (i.e. M 2CO2, where M = Sc, Y, La) thin films have been confirmed to possess piezoelectric voltage characteristics. Density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) calculations indicate that M 2CO2 MXene materials have high elastic coefficients and Poisson's ratios, showcasing excellent mechanical properties. Notably, the piezoelectric stress coefficient e 11 of Y2CO2 reaches as high as \u2212394.49 pm/V, significantly higher than that of Sc2CO2(\u2212285 pm/V). Conversely, Sc2CO2exhibits a higher out-of-plane piezoelectric stress coefficient e 31 (\u2212196 pm/V) compared to Y2CO2 (\u221288 pm/V). To further enhance the out-of-plane piezoelectric coefficient of Y2CO2, we used density functional perturbation theory to simulate thin films of MXenes Y2COX (X = O, S, Se) and successfully predicted their mechanical and piezoelectric properties. Previously, MXenes with surface terminations such as O, Cl, S, Se, and Br were successfully synthesized through substitution and elimination reactions in molten inorganic salts, and these MXenes exhibited unique properties. Inspired by these findings, we selected O, S, and Se as the lower surface termination elements for Y2CO. The non-centrosymmetric adsorption of different atoms on the top and bottom surfaces of Y2C breaks the inversion symmetry of M2C. Through further theoretical calculations, we confirmed that MXene Y2COX materials not only exhibit semiconducting behaviour but also demonstrate high mechanical stability. Due to their semiconducting behaviour and inversion asymmetry, MXene Y2COX materials display substantial out-of-plane piezoelectric properties. With their high mechanical stability and significant out-of-plane piezoelectric coefficients, MXene Y2COX materials show great promise for applications in wearable devices and energy harvesting modules. These discoveries not only provide new insights into the study of MXenes but also open up new possibilities for the development of future functional materials.

# CONCLUSION
We successfully predicted and verified that the Y2COX (Y2CO2, Y2COS, Y2COSe) monolayer structures exhibit outstanding piezoelectric performance in both the in-plane and out-of-plane directions. Calculations of the phonon spectra, AIMD diagrams, formation energies, COPH spectra, as well as Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio, demonstrate that this material not only possesses excellent dynamical, thermodynamic, and chemical bond stability but also exhibits good mechanical properties, making it an exceptionally flexible material. Among these three MXene monolayers, the Y2COS and Y2COSe monolayers have larger values of d 33 (\u2013398.49 pm/V and \u2013311.76 pm/V) due to their superior flexibility (Young's moduli of 72.32 N/m and 70.72 N/m and Poisson's ratios of 0.52 and 0.52)and strong average planar electrostatic potential differences (\u0394\u03a6 = 4.06 eV and 4.10 eV), and their d\u2083\u2083 piezoelectric coefficients are 1 to 3 orders of magnitude higher than d 22 or d 31. We found that the out-of-plane piezoelectric stress coefficient |e 33| increases as the difference in electronegativity decreases. These excellent properties grant Y2COS and Y2COSe monolayer films tremendous potential and prospects in applications such as energy harvesting modules and wearable devices.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
We calculated the monolayer structures of Y2COX (X = O, S, Se) using first-principles methods, as shown in. In the top-down view of the xy-plane, the dashed box outlines the primitive unit cell of the Y2COX crystal structure, with each primitive unit containing 5 atoms. The directions of the crystallographic axes are denoted by a and b, and a\u2080 denotes the lattice constant. In Fig. 1(a)\u2013(c), a\u2080 is 7.43 \xc5, 3.83 \xc5, and 3.82 \xc5, respectively. From the top-down view of the xy-plane, the overall Y\u2082COX lattice structure exhibits a honeycomb pattern, which is composed of transition metal Y atoms. The vertical distances between the topmost O atoms and the middle C atoms (h 1) and between the bottom X atoms and the middle C atoms (h 2) are shown in , where h 1is smaller than h 2 for all three structures. By comparing the values of h 1 and h 2 in Fig. 1(a)\u2013(c), we observe significant differences in h 1 and h 2 for Figure 1(b) and 1(c). This indicates that the atomic radii of S and Se in the Y2COS and Y2COSe structures are considerably larger than that of O, leading to the pronounced differences in h\u2081 and h\u2082. In this study, we only investigate er MXenes, without considering interactions between adjacent layers. To investigate the stability of the Y2COX monolayer, we calculated the phonon dispersion spectra and AIMD spectra of the Y\u2082COX monolayer, as shown in the figure. The phonon spectra in (a)-(c) indicate that the three red curves with zero frequency at the high-symmetry point \u0393 represent the acoustic branches, while the black curves with non-zero frequencies correspond to the optical branches. The absence of imaginary vibrational frequencies in the acoustic branches near the high-symmetry points (\u0393, M, K) demonstrates that Y2COX MXenes can exist stably from a dynamical perspective. From the phonon density of states (PHDOS) spectra, it is evident that the phonon states of the heavier atoms are primarily concentrated in the low-frequency region, whereas those of the lighter atoms are mainly found in the high-frequency region. Additionally, we performed AIMD simulations using a 3 \xd7 3 \xd7 1 supercell to analyse the energy fluctuations of each atom at room temperature (300 K) for Y2COX (X = O, S, Se) under NVT ensemble conditions over 2000 steps (with a timestep of 3 fs), as shown in (d)-(f). This confirms that Y2COX (X = O, S, Se) maintains thermal stability at room temperature. We also calculated the phonon spectra of Y2CSO and Y2CSeO, and the results show significant imaginary frequencies in their phonon spectra, proving that the Y2CSO and Y2CSeO structures are unstable (see Figure S1). To assess the thermodynamic stability of Y2COX materials, we calculated their formation energies using the following formula : where \u03b5 is the total energy of the Y2COX monolayer, \u03b51, \u03b52, \u03b53 , and \u03b54 are the crystal energies per atom of Y, C, O, and X in Y2COX, respectively, a, b, c, and d denote the number of atoms for each element in the unit cell, and N (N = a + b + c + d) is the total number of atoms. Through calculations, we obtained negative formation energies for Y2CO2, Y2COS, and Y2COSe, as shown in , proving their thermodynamic stability. To prevent leakage currents during polarization, we performed calculations of the electronic band structure and density of states (DOS) to thoroughly investigate the electronic properties of Y2CO2, Y2COS, and Y2COSe. Notably, while Y2CO2 behaves as an indirect bandgap semiconductor, Y2COS and Y2COSe are direct bandgap semiconductors, demonstrating their significant potential in the field of piezoelectric materials. To obtain more accurate and reliable results for the band structure calculations, we employed a combination of PBE and HSE06 methods to compute the bandgaps. By comparing (a)-(c), we can clearly observe the changes in bandgaps for Y2CO2, Y2COS, and Y2COSe under PBE and HSE06 computational levels. The bandgaps at the PBE level are 1.25 eV, 1.07 eV, and 0.65 eV, respectively, showing a decreasing trend from Y2CO2 to Y2COSe. At the HSE06 level, the bandgaps are 2.26 eV, 2.06 eV, and 1.51 eV, which are larger in magnitude compared to the PBE results, although the relative trend remains unchanged. The smaller bandgaps of Y2COS and Y2COSe compared to Y2CO2 indicate that substituting O atoms with S or Se atoms not only alters the type of bandgap but also effectively reduces the width of the bandgap. Consequently, valence band electrons require a relatively wider bandgap to transition into the conduction band, which explains why Y2COS has a wider bandgap than Y2COSe. Near the Fermi level, the conduction band and valence band of Y2COX are primarily contributed by the d orbitals of the Y atoms and the p orbitals of the C, O, and X (X = O, S, Se) atoms, as shown in Figure S2. (d)-(f) present the COHP (Crystal Orbital Hamilton Population) spectra for the Y-X and show that MXenes such as M2C and M2CO2 have been experimentally synthesized. Therefore, in this study, we focused solely on the COHP of Y-X (X = O, S, Se) atoms. We found that the Fermi levels of all three MXenes lie within the bonding state region, with no or only minimal antibonding state regions below the Fermi level (\u03b5F). Furthermore, considering that Y is a heavy element, the electronic band structures of these three materials were calculated using the PBE functional with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) to enhance their accuracy. As shown in (a)-(c), SOC breaks the spin degeneracy and induces valley spin splitting at the high-symmetry K points in the conduction band due to the presence of an electric dipole moment. We found that the valence bands exhibit significant spin splitting along the M-K and K-\u0393 directions, while the bands along the \u0393-M direction show smaller spin splitting. In the Y2COX (X = O, S, Se) structure, the symmetry breaking leads to an in-plane average electrostatic potential difference in the Y2COX monolayer. The work function, which gives the minimum energy required for electrons to escape from the surface, can be expressed by the formula \u03a6 = E-E F, where \u03a6 is the work function, E is the vacuum energy level in the stationary state, and E F is the Fermi level, as shown in. For the Y2COS monolayer structure, the work functions of the bottom S atom and the top O atom are 6.46 eV and 2.40 eV, respectively, resulting in a plane-averaged electrostatic potential difference of 4.06 eV in the vertical direction. Similarly, the Y2CO2 and Y2COSe monolayer structures also generate electrostatic potential differences of 1.65 eV and 4.10 eV, respectively, which causes the three monolayer structures to exhibit a significant vertical built-in electric field (E int). According to the formula E int = \u0394\u03a6/eh (where e is the charge of the electron and h is the thickness of the monolayer structure), the intensities of the built-in electric field for Y2CO2, Y2COS, and Y2COSe are 0.41 eV/\xc5, 0.87 eV/\xc5, and 0.84 eV/\xc5, respectively. The Y2COS monolayer has the largest built-in electric field, indicating the strongest vertical polarization. The larger built-in electric field in the Y2COS monolayer results in a stronger vertical polarization, providing a larger d 33 to enhance the out-of-plane piezoelectricity. We calculated the differential charge density so as to understand the charge distribution in Y2COX materials further. The differential charge density is commonly used to describe charge distributions: it gives the difference between the charge density of a Y2COX material and the sum of the individual atomic charge densities. It is expressed as \u0394\u03c1 ( r\u2192)=\u03c1 [ Y2COX]\u2212 \u2211\u03bc \u03c1 atom ( r\u2192\u2212 R \u03bc\u2192). We also performed Bader charge analyses on the Y2COX monolayers. The three-dimensional differential charge density isosurface level is set at 0.01 e/\xc5\xb3. The maximum total electron transfer for the three materials is approximately 3.43|e|. We also calculated the ratio of electron gain for O, C, and X atoms in the three materials as 1:0.67:0.8, 1:0.93:0.75, and 1:0.72:0.52, respectively. When X is O, h 1 and h 2 in the Y2CO2 structure are relatively close to those of Y2COS and Y2COSe. The values of h 1 and h 2 are shown in. When X is S or Se, the difference between h 1 and h 2 in the Y2COS and Y2COSe structures is larger than for Y2CO2. Therefore, Y2COS and Y2COSe may exhibit greater piezoelectric performance in the vertical direction than Y2CO2. However, the h 1 and h 2 in Y2COS and Y2COSe are relatively close, and the S atoms gain more electrons than the Se atoms. Consequently, Y2COS may exhibit greater piezoelectric performance in the vertical direction than Y2COSe. To achieve high-efficiency electromechanical conversion in Y2COX, the key lies in satisfying the requirements of plastic deformation under applied stress. According to the Born\u2212Huang criteria, the elastic stiffness coefficients of Y2COX must satisfy the equations C 11 C 22-C 122 > 0 and C 66 > 0, indicating that Y2COX possesses good mechanical properties. The elastic stiffness coefficients of Y2COX are shown in. The formulas for Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio are where A=(C 11 C 22-C 122)/C 66-2C 12, B=C 11+C 22-(C 11 C 22-C 122/C 66, C 11 =C 22, and \u03b8 is an arbitrary angle related to the X-axis. Using formulas (2) and (3), we calculated Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio for Y2CO2, Y2COS, and Y2COSe. As shown in , the results of these calculations demonstrate the strong isotropic characteristics of the Y2COX system in terms of mechanical properties. When the angle \u03b8 is 0\xb0 or 90\xb0, the Young's modulus of Y2CO2, Y2COS, and Y2COSe are 99.53, 72.32, and 70.72 N/m, respectively, while their Poisson's ratios are 0.55, 0.52, and 0.52, respectively. It is noteworthy that when S and Se atoms replace O atoms, the Young's modulus of Y2COX shows a decreasing trend, while Poisson's ratio increases. This implies that Y2COS and Y2COSe are structurally more flexible than Y2CO2 and other materials. For example, compared to monolayer Sc2CO2 (Young's modulus of 120 N/m) and penta-CNP (minimum Young's modulus of 172 N/m) , the lower Young's modulus of Y2COS and Y2COSe makes them more advantageous in fields such as flexible electronic devices and wearable equipment that require a certain degree of flexibility. To accurately investigate the piezoelectric properties of Y2COX materials, we used the density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) method to calculate the piezoelectric stress coefficients (eijk ) and the finite element method to determine the elastic stiffness coefficients (Ckl ). The piezoelectric strain coefficients (dijk) can be derived from their relations with the piezoelectric stress coefficients (eijk ):  Here, \u03b5jk, \u03c3jk, Pi , and Ei denote the strain tensor, stress tensor, polarization vector, and macroscopic electric field, respectively, with i, j, and k referring to the x, y, and z directions. According to the Voigt notation, we simplify the expressions of these coefficients, allowing the abbreviation of dijk and eijk as dil and eil , where l stands for xx (1), yy (2), zz (3), yz (4), zx (5) and xy (6). Therefore, based on the Voigt notation, the direct relations between the elastic stiffness coefficients, stress piezoelectric coefficients, and strain piezoelectric coefficients are as follows: where the elastic stiffness matrix  The piezoelectric strain coefficient matrix is  Thus, through matrix operations, we obtain the three strain piezoelectric coefficients of interest: d22, d31, and d33, with their specific expressions as  The results of the calculations are shown in , where e 21 = -e 22 and e 31 = e 32. It is evident that for the three materials Y2CO2, Y2COS, and Y2COSe, the absence of a centre of inversion symmetry leads to both the in-plane piezoelectric stress coefficient e 21 and the out-of-plane piezoelectric stress coefficient e 31 being non-zero. Additionally, the out-of-plane piezoelectric stress coefficients e 33 for the Y2COS and Y2COSe structures are greater than that of the Y2CO2 structure. Notably, the Y2COS structure exhibits a remarkably large out-of-plane piezoelectric strain coefficient d 33 = \u2212398.49 pm/V, d 31 = 0.22pm/V, and an in-plane piezoelectric strain coefficient d 22= \u221212.2 pm/V. Similarly, the Y2COSe structure demonstrates relatively impressive piezoelectric coefficients (d 33 = \u2212311.76 pm/V, d 31 = 0.15 pm/V, d 22 = \u221215.01 pm/V). The reason for these results is that the Young's moduli of Y2COS and Y2COSe are significantly lower than that of Y2CO2, resulting in better flexibility for Y2COS and Y2COSe materials. For example, the MXenes Sc2COS (d 33 = 54.47 pm/V) and Sc2COSe (d 33 = 75.88 pm/V) , Janus \u03b3-GeSnSO (d 33 = 4.29 pm/V) and \u03b3-GeSnSeO (d 33 = 2.80 pm/V) , and Janus CrBr1.5I1.5 (d 22 = 0.557 pm/V). Additionally, compared to some experimentally synthesized materials, they also exhibit superior out-of-plane piezoelectric coefficients, such as CdS thin films (d 33 = 32.8 pm/V) , 3R-MoS2 flakes (d 33 = 0.9 pm/V) , and (BiFeO3)0.7(PbTiO3)0.3 ceramics (d 33 = 160 pm/V) , among others. Finally, it is noteworthy that d 33 is one to three orders of magnitude higher than d 22 or d 31. In the figure, the cyan area indicates Y2CO2, the yellow area indicates Y2COS, and the green area indicates Y2COSe. The electronegativity for each element in these materials are Y (1.22), C (2.55), O (3.44), S (2.58), and Se (2.55). Here, we introduced an R atom to replace the Y-C atomic layer, and the relative electronegativity value of the R atom, R eln, can be expressed as   Therefore, the electronegativity difference ratio (red) for Y2COX monolayers can be obtained using the following formula:  It was observed that for Y2COX (X = O, S, Se), as X changes from O to S to Se, |d33 | first increases and then decreases, while |e33 | shows a progressive increase. Due to the small difference in electronegativity between S and Se atoms, the |d33 | and |e33 | of Y2COS and Y2COSe are relatively close compared to those of Y2CO2.

# ABSTRACT
Through the ongoing exploration of two-dimensional materials, MXene thin films have gradually emerged as outstanding candidates for piezoelectric applications, due to their excellent electrical conductivity, large specific surface area, tunable bandgap, and remarkable flexibility. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we thoroughly investigate the effects of oxygen, sulfur, and selenium on the piezoelectric properties of Y2COX (X = O, S, Se) MXene monolayers. Our results demonstrate that Y2COX MXene monolayers exhibit good stability in terms of their thermodynamics, kinetics, and mechanical properties, while also possessing large out-of-plane piezoelectric coefficients. Specifically, the out-of-plane strain piezoelectric coefficients d

# INTRODUCTION
For example, Janus monolayers such as MoXSiN2 (X = S, Se, Te) and BMX 2 (M = Ga, In and X = S, Se) generate piezoelectric effects due to their broken structural symmetry. MXene materials with Janus structures are also a class of two-dimensional transition metal carbides or nitrides that exhibit piezoelectric properties due to the breaking of a structural symmetry. Their general chemical formula is Mn+1X\u2099Tx (where M = Ti, Sc, Y, Nb, etc.; X = C, N; T = -O, -OH, -F, -S, etc.) , with n ranging from 1 to 3, and x denoting the number of terminal functional groups T. Examples of MXenes include Ti2C, Sc2CO2, and Sc2CS2. Since their introduction, MXenes have quickly garnered widespread attention in fields such as functional materials, energy storage, and biomedicine, owing to their excellent electrical  and optical  properties, as well as their abundant surface functional groups. Whether MXenes also possess outstanding piezoelectric coefficients is, then, worth exploring. Numerous studies have indicated that MXenes exhibit high electrical conductivity, large specific surface areas, good toughness, and tunable band gaps, all of which contribute to their tremendous potential in the piezoelectric product sector. According to reports, M 2CO2 MXene materials exhibit semiconducting behaviour and inversion asymmetry, demonstrating significant polarization and piezoelectric responses in both the in-plane and out-of-plane directions. Specifically, oxygen-functionalized MXene (i.e. M 2CO2, where M = Sc, Y, La) thin films have been confirmed to possess piezoelectric voltage characteristics. Density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) calculations indicate that M 2CO2 MXene materials have high elastic coefficients and Poisson's ratios, showcasing excellent mechanical properties. Notably, the piezoelectric stress coefficient e 11 of Y2CO2 reaches as high as \u2212394.49 pm/V, significantly higher than that of Sc2CO2(\u2212285 pm/V). Conversely, Sc2CO2exhibits a higher out-of-plane piezoelectric stress coefficient e 31 (\u2212196 pm/V) compared to Y2CO2 (\u221288 pm/V). To further enhance the out-of-plane piezoelectric coefficient of Y2CO2, we used density functional perturbation theory to simulate thin films of MXenes Y2COX (X = O, S, Se) and successfully predicted their mechanical and piezoelectric properties. Previously, MXenes with surface terminations such as O, Cl, S, Se, and Br were successfully synthesized through substitution and elimination reactions in molten inorganic salts, and these MXenes exhibited unique properties. Inspired by these findings, we selected O, S, and Se as the lower surface termination elements for Y2CO. The non-centrosymmetric adsorption of different atoms on the top and bottom surfaces of Y2C breaks the inversion symmetry of M2C. Through further theoretical calculations, we confirmed that MXene Y2COX materials not only exhibit semiconducting behaviour but also demonstrate high mechanical stability. Due to their semiconducting behaviour and inversion asymmetry, MXene Y2COX materials display substantial out-of-plane piezoelectric properties. With their high mechanical stability and significant out-of-plane piezoelectric coefficients, MXene Y2COX materials show great promise for applications in wearable devices and energy harvesting modules. These discoveries not only provide new insights into the study of MXenes but also open up new possibilities for the development of future functional materials.

# CONCLUSION
We successfully predicted and verified that the Y2COX (Y2CO2, Y2COS, Y2COSe) monolayer structures exhibit outstanding piezoelectric performance in both the in-plane and out-of-plane directions. Calculations of the phonon spectra, AIMD diagrams, formation energies, COPH spectra, as well as Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio, demonstrate that this material not only possesses excellent dynamical, thermodynamic, and chemical bond stability but also exhibits good mechanical properties, making it an exceptionally flexible material. Among these three MXene monolayers, the Y2COS and Y2COSe monolayers have larger values of d 33 (\u2013398.49 pm/V and \u2013311.76 pm/V) due to their superior flexibility (Young's moduli of 72.32 N/m and 70.72 N/m and Poisson's ratios of 0.52 and 0.52)and strong average planar electrostatic potential differences (\u0394\u03a6 = 4.06 eV and 4.10 eV), and their d\u2083\u2083 piezoelectric coefficients are 1 to 3 orders of magnitude higher than d 22 or d 31. We found that the out-of-plane piezoelectric stress coefficient |e 33| increases as the difference in electronegativity decreases. These excellent properties grant Y2COS and Y2COSe monolayer films tremendous potential and prospects in applications such as energy harvesting modules and wearable devices.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
We calculated the monolayer structures of Y2COX (X = O, S, Se) using first-principles methods, as shown in. In the top-down view of the xy-plane, the dashed box outlines the primitive unit cell of the Y2COX crystal structure, with each primitive unit containing 5 atoms. The directions of the crystallographic axes are denoted by a and b, and a\u2080 denotes the lattice constant. In Fig. 1(a)\u2013(c), a\u2080 is 7.43 \xc5, 3.83 \xc5, and 3.82 \xc5, respectively. From the top-down view of the xy-plane, the overall Y\u2082COX lattice structure exhibits a honeycomb pattern, which is composed of transition metal Y atoms. The vertical distances between the topmost O atoms and the middle C atoms (h 1) and between the bottom X atoms and the middle C atoms (h 2) are shown in , where h 1is smaller than h 2 for all three structures. By comparing the values of h 1 and h 2 in Fig. 1(a)\u2013(c), we observe significant differences in h 1 and h 2 for Figure 1(b) and 1(c). This indicates that the atomic radii of S and Se in the Y2COS and Y2COSe structures are considerably larger than that of O, leading to the pronounced differences in h\u2081 and h\u2082. In this study, we only investigate er MXenes, without considering interactions between adjacent layers. To investigate the stability of the Y2COX monolayer, we calculated the phonon dispersion spectra and AIMD spectra of the Y\u2082COX monolayer, as shown in the figure. The phonon spectra in (a)-(c) indicate that the three red curves with zero frequency at the high-symmetry point \u0393 represent the acoustic branches, while the black curves with non-zero frequencies correspond to the optical branches. The absence of imaginary vibrational frequencies in the acoustic branches near the high-symmetry points (\u0393, M, K) demonstrates that Y2COX MXenes can exist stably from a dynamical perspective. From the phonon density of states (PHDOS) spectra, it is evident that the phonon states of the heavier atoms are primarily concentrated in the low-frequency region, whereas those of the lighter atoms are mainly found in the high-frequency region. Additionally, we performed AIMD simulations using a 3 \xd7 3 \xd7 1 supercell to analyse the energy fluctuations of each atom at room temperature (300 K) for Y2COX (X = O, S, Se) under NVT ensemble conditions over 2000 steps (with a timestep of 3 fs), as shown in (d)-(f). This confirms that Y2COX (X = O, S, Se) maintains thermal stability at room temperature. We also calculated the phonon spectra of Y2CSO and Y2CSeO, and the results show significant imaginary frequencies in their phonon spectra, proving that the Y2CSO and Y2CSeO structures are unstable (see Figure S1). To assess the thermodynamic stability of Y2COX materials, we calculated their formation energies using the following formula : where \u03b5 is the total energy of the Y2COX monolayer, \u03b51, \u03b52, \u03b53 , and \u03b54 are the crystal energies per atom of Y, C, O, and X in Y2COX, respectively, a, b, c, and d denote the number of atoms for each element in the unit cell, and N (N = a + b + c + d) is the total number of atoms. Through calculations, we obtained negative formation energies for Y2CO2, Y2COS, and Y2COSe, as shown in , proving their thermodynamic stability. To prevent leakage currents during polarization, we performed calculations of the electronic band structure and density of states (DOS) to thoroughly investigate the electronic properties of Y2CO2, Y2COS, and Y2COSe. Notably, while Y2CO2 behaves as an indirect bandgap semiconductor, Y2COS and Y2COSe are direct bandgap semiconductors, demonstrating their significant potential in the field of piezoelectric materials. To obtain more accurate and reliable results for the band structure calculations, we employed a combination of PBE and HSE06 methods to compute the bandgaps. By comparing (a)-(c), we can clearly observe the changes in bandgaps for Y2CO2, Y2COS, and Y2COSe under PBE and HSE06 computational levels. The bandgaps at the PBE level are 1.25 eV, 1.07 eV, and 0.65 eV, respectively, showing a decreasing trend from Y2CO2 to Y2COSe. At the HSE06 level, the bandgaps are 2.26 eV, 2.06 eV, and 1.51 eV, which are larger in magnitude compared to the PBE results, although the relative trend remains unchanged. The smaller bandgaps of Y2COS and Y2COSe compared to Y2CO2 indicate that substituting O atoms with S or Se atoms not only alters the type of bandgap but also effectively reduces the width of the bandgap. Consequently, valence band electrons require a relatively wider bandgap to transition into the conduction band, which explains why Y2COS has a wider bandgap than Y2COSe. Near the Fermi level, the conduction band and valence band of Y2COX are primarily contributed by the d orbitals of the Y atoms and the p orbitals of the C, O, and X (X = O, S, Se) atoms, as shown in Figure S2. (d)-(f) present the COHP (Crystal Orbital Hamilton Population) spectra for the Y-X and show that MXenes such as M2C and M2CO2 have been experimentally synthesized. Therefore, in this study, we focused solely on the COHP of Y-X (X = O, S, Se) atoms. We found that the Fermi levels of all three MXenes lie within the bonding state region, with no or only minimal antibonding state regions below the Fermi level (\u03b5F). Furthermore, considering that Y is a heavy element, the electronic band structures of these three materials were calculated using the PBE functional with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) to enhance their accuracy. As shown in (a)-(c), SOC breaks the spin degeneracy and induces valley spin splitting at the high-symmetry K points in the conduction band due to the presence of an electric dipole moment. We found that the valence bands exhibit significant spin splitting along the M-K and K-\u0393 directions, while the bands along the \u0393-M direction show smaller spin splitting. In the Y2COX (X = O, S, Se) structure, the symmetry breaking leads to an in-plane average electrostatic potential difference in the Y2COX monolayer. The work function, which gives the minimum energy required for electrons to escape from the surface, can be expressed by the formula \u03a6 = E-E F, where \u03a6 is the work function, E is the vacuum energy level in the stationary state, and E F is the Fermi level, as shown in. For the Y2COS monolayer structure, the work functions of the bottom S atom and the top O atom are 6.46 eV and 2.40 eV, respectively, resulting in a plane-averaged electrostatic potential difference of 4.06 eV in the vertical direction. Similarly, the Y2CO2 and Y2COSe monolayer structures also generate electrostatic potential differences of 1.65 eV and 4.10 eV, respectively, which causes the three monolayer structures to exhibit a significant vertical built-in electric field (E int). According to the formula E int = \u0394\u03a6/eh (where e is the charge of the electron and h is the thickness of the monolayer structure), the intensities of the built-in electric field for Y2CO2, Y2COS, and Y2COSe are 0.41 eV/\xc5, 0.87 eV/\xc5, and 0.84 eV/\xc5, respectively. The Y2COS monolayer has the largest built-in electric field, indicating the strongest vertical polarization. The larger built-in electric field in the Y2COS monolayer results in a stronger vertical polarization, providing a larger d 33 to enhance the out-of-plane piezoelectricity. We calculated the differential charge density so as to understand the charge distribution in Y2COX materials further. The differential charge density is commonly used to describe charge distributions: it gives the difference between the charge density of a Y2COX material and the sum of the individual atomic charge densities. It is expressed as \u0394\u03c1 ( r\u2192)=\u03c1 [ Y2COX]\u2212 \u2211\u03bc \u03c1 atom ( r\u2192\u2212 R \u03bc\u2192). We also performed Bader charge analyses on the Y2COX monolayers. The three-dimensional differential charge density isosurface level is set at 0.01 e/\xc5\xb3. The maximum total electron transfer for the three materials is approximately 3.43|e|. We also calculated the ratio of electron gain for O, C, and X atoms in the three materials as 1:0.67:0.8, 1:0.93:0.75, and 1:0.72:0.52, respectively. When X is O, h 1 and h 2 in the Y2CO2 structure are relatively close to those of Y2COS and Y2COSe. The values of h 1 and h 2 are shown in. When X is S or Se, the difference between h 1 and h 2 in the Y2COS and Y2COSe structures is larger than for Y2CO2. Therefore, Y2COS and Y2COSe may exhibit greater piezoelectric performance in the vertical direction than Y2CO2. However, the h 1 and h 2 in Y2COS and Y2COSe are relatively close, and the S atoms gain more electrons than the Se atoms. Consequently, Y2COS may exhibit greater piezoelectric performance in the vertical direction than Y2COSe. To achieve high-efficiency electromechanical conversion in Y2COX, the key lies in satisfying the requirements of plastic deformation under applied stress. According to the Born\u2212Huang criteria, the elastic stiffness coefficients of Y2COX must satisfy the equations C 11 C 22-C 122 > 0 and C 66 > 0, indicating that Y2COX possesses good mechanical properties. The elastic stiffness coefficients of Y2COX are shown in. The formulas for Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio are where A=(C 11 C 22-C 122)/C 66-2C 12, B=C 11+C 22-(C 11 C 22-C 122/C 66, C 11 =C 22, and \u03b8 is an arbitrary angle related to the X-axis. Using formulas (2) and (3), we calculated Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio for Y2CO2, Y2COS, and Y2COSe. As shown in , the results of these calculations demonstrate the strong isotropic characteristics of the Y2COX system in terms of mechanical properties. When the angle \u03b8 is 0\xb0 or 90\xb0, the Young's modulus of Y2CO2, Y2COS, and Y2COSe are 99.53, 72.32, and 70.72 N/m, respectively, while their Poisson's ratios are 0.55, 0.52, and 0.52, respectively. It is noteworthy that when S and Se atoms replace O atoms, the Young's modulus of Y2COX shows a decreasing trend, while Poisson's ratio increases. This implies that Y2COS and Y2COSe are structurally more flexible than Y2CO2 and other materials. For example, compared to monolayer Sc2CO2 (Young's modulus of 120 N/m) and penta-CNP (minimum Young's modulus of 172 N/m) , the lower Young's modulus of Y2COS and Y2COSe makes them more advantageous in fields such as flexible electronic devices and wearable equipment that require a certain degree of flexibility. To accurately investigate the piezoelectric properties of Y2COX materials, we used the density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) method to calculate the piezoelectric stress coefficients (eijk ) and the finite element method to determine the elastic stiffness coefficients (Ckl ). The piezoelectric strain coefficients (dijk) can be derived from their relations with the piezoelectric stress coefficients (eijk ):  Here, \u03b5jk, \u03c3jk, Pi , and Ei denote the strain tensor, stress tensor, polarization vector, and macroscopic electric field, respectively, with i, j, and k referring to the x, y, and z directions. According to the Voigt notation, we simplify the expressions of these coefficients, allowing the abbreviation of dijk and eijk as dil and eil , where l stands for xx (1), yy (2), zz (3), yz (4), zx (5) and xy (6). Therefore, based on the Voigt notation, the direct relations between the elastic stiffness coefficients, stress piezoelectric coefficients, and strain piezoelectric coefficients are as follows: where the elastic stiffness matrix  The piezoelectric strain coefficient matrix is  Thus, through matrix operations, we obtain the three strain piezoelectric coefficients of interest: d22, d31, and d33, with their specific expressions as  The results of the calculations are shown in , where e 21 = -e 22 and e 31 = e 32. It is evident that for the three materials Y2CO2, Y2COS, and Y2COSe, the absence of a centre of inversion symmetry leads to both the in-plane piezoelectric stress coefficient e 21 and the out-of-plane piezoelectric stress coefficient e 31 being non-zero. Additionally, the out-of-plane piezoelectric stress coefficients e 33 for the Y2COS and Y2COSe structures are greater than that of the Y2CO2 structure. Notably, the Y2COS structure exhibits a remarkably large out-of-plane piezoelectric strain coefficient d 33 = \u2212398.49 pm/V, d 31 = 0.22pm/V, and an in-plane piezoelectric strain coefficient d 22= \u221212.2 pm/V. Similarly, the Y2COSe structure demonstrates relatively impressive piezoelectric coefficients (d 33 = \u2212311.76 pm/V, d 31 = 0.15 pm/V, d 22 = \u221215.01 pm/V). The reason for these results is that the Young's moduli of Y2COS and Y2COSe are significantly lower than that of Y2CO2, resulting in better flexibility for Y2COS and Y2COSe materials. For example, the MXenes Sc2COS (d 33 = 54.47 pm/V) and Sc2COSe (d 33 = 75.88 pm/V) , Janus \u03b3-GeSnSO (d 33 = 4.29 pm/V) and \u03b3-GeSnSeO (d 33 = 2.80 pm/V) , and Janus CrBr1.5I1.5 (d 22 = 0.557 pm/V). Additionally, compared to some experimentally synthesized materials, they also exhibit superior out-of-plane piezoelectric coefficients, such as CdS thin films (d 33 = 32.8 pm/V) , 3R-MoS2 flakes (d 33 = 0.9 pm/V) , and (BiFeO3)0.7(PbTiO3)0.3 ceramics (d 33 = 160 pm/V) , among others. Finally, it is noteworthy that d 33 is one to three orders of magnitude higher than d 22 or d 31. In the figure, the cyan area indicates Y2CO2, the yellow area indicates Y2COS, and the green area indicates Y2COSe. The electronegativity for each element in these materials are Y (1.22), C (2.55), O (3.44), S (2.58), and Se (2.55). Here, we introduced an R atom to replace the Y-C atomic layer, and the relative electronegativity value of the R atom, R eln, can be expressed as   Therefore, the electronegativity difference ratio (red) for Y2COX monolayers can be obtained using the following formula:  It was observed that for Y2COX (X = O, S, Se), as X changes from O to S to Se, |d33 | first increases and then decreases, while |e33 | shows a progressive increase. Due to the small difference in electronegativity between S and Se atoms, the |d33 | and |e33 | of Y2COS and Y2COSe are relatively close compared to those of Y2CO2.

# ABSTRACT
Through the ongoing exploration of two-dimensional materials, MXene thin films have gradually emerged as outstanding candidates for piezoelectric applications, due to their excellent electrical conductivity, large specific surface area, tunable bandgap, and remarkable flexibility.

# INTRODUCTION
For example, Janus monolayers such as MoXSiN2 (X = S, Se, Te) and BMX 2 (M = Ga, In and X = S, Se) generate piezoelectric effects due to their broken structural symmetry. MXene materials with Janus structures are also a class of two-dimensional transition metal carbides or nitrides that exhibit piezoelectric properties due to the breaking of a structural symmetry. Their general chemical formula is Mn+1X\u2099Tx (where M = Ti, Sc, Y, Nb, etc.; X = C, N; T = -O, -OH, -F, -S, etc.) , with n ranging from 1 to 3, and x denoting the number of terminal functional groups T. Examples of MXenes include Ti2C, Sc2CO2, and Sc2CS2. Since their introduction, MXenes have quickly garnered widespread attention in fields such as functional materials, energy storage, and biomedicine, owing to their excellent electrical  and optical  properties, as well as their abundant surface functional groups. Whether MXenes also possess outstanding piezoelectric coefficients is, then, worth exploring. Numerous studies have indicated that MXenes exhibit high electrical conductivity, large specific surface areas, good toughness, and tunable band gaps, all of which contribute to their tremendous potential in the piezoelectric product sector. According to reports, M 2CO2 MXene materials exhibit semiconducting behaviour and inversion asymmetry, demonstrating significant polarization and piezoelectric responses in both the in-plane and out-of-plane directions. Specifically, oxygen-functionalized MXene (i.e. M 2CO2, where M = Sc, Y, La) thin films have been confirmed to possess piezoelectric voltage characteristics. Density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) calculations indicate that M 2CO2 MXene materials have high elastic coefficients and Poisson's ratios, showcasing excellent mechanical properties. Notably, the piezoelectric stress coefficient e 11 of Y2CO2 reaches as high as \u2212394.49 pm/V, significantly higher than that of Sc2CO2(\u2212285 pm/V). Conversely, Sc2CO2exhibits a higher out-of-plane piezoelectric stress coefficient e 31 (\u2212196 pm/V) compared to Y2CO2 (\u221288 pm/V). To further enhance the out-of-plane piezoelectric coefficient of Y2CO2, we used density functional perturbation theory to simulate thin films of MXenes Y2COX (X = O, S, Se) and successfully predicted their mechanical and piezoelectric properties. Previously, MXenes with surface terminations such as O, Cl, S, Se, and Br were successfully synthesized through substitution and elimination reactions in molten inorganic salts, and these MXenes exhibited unique properties. Inspired by these findings, we selected O, S, and Se as the lower surface termination elements for Y2CO. The non-centrosymmetric adsorption of different atoms on the top and bottom surfaces of Y2C breaks the inversion symmetry of M2C. Through further theoretical calculations, we confirmed that MXene Y2COX materials not only exhibit semiconducting behaviour but also demonstrate high mechanical stability. Due to their semiconducting behaviour and inversion asymmetry, MXene Y2COX materials display substantial out-of-plane piezoelectric properties. With their high mechanical stability and significant out-of-plane piezoelectric coefficients, MXene Y2COX materials show great promise for applications in wearable devices and energy harvesting modules. These discoveries not only provide new insights into the study of MXenes but also open up new possibilities for the development of future functional materials.

# CONCLUSION
We successfully predicted and verified that the Y2COX (Y2CO2, Y2COS, Y2COSe) monolayer structures exhibit outstanding piezoelectric performance in both the in-plane and out-of-plane directions. Calculations of the phonon spectra, AIMD diagrams, formation energies, COPH spectra, as well as Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio, demonstrate that this material not only possesses excellent dynamical, thermodynamic, and chemical bond stability but also exhibits good mechanical properties, making it an exceptionally flexible material. Among these three MXene monolayers, the Y2COS and Y2COSe monolayers have larger values of d 33 (\u2013398.49 pm/V and \u2013311.76 pm/V) due to their superior flexibility (Young's moduli of 72.32 N/m and 70.72 N/m and Poisson's ratios of 0.52 and 0.52)and strong average planar electrostatic potential differences (\u0394\u03a6 = 4.06 eV and 4.10 eV), and their d\u2083\u2083 piezoelectric coefficients are 1 to 3 orders of magnitude higher than d 22 or d 31. We found that the out-of-plane piezoelectric stress coefficient |e 33| increases as the difference in electronegativity decreases. These excellent properties grant Y2COS and Y2COSe monolayer films tremendous potential and prospects in applications such as energy harvesting modules and wearable devices.
